# Optimize Docker Image Build Times

Implement comprehensive strategies to reduce Docker image build times through layer optimization, caching improvements, and build process enhancements.

## Summary of changes

- Current Docker builds are likely inefficient due to poor layer ordering, lack of multi-stage builds, and suboptimal caching strategies
- Implement multi-stage builds to separate build dependencies from runtime dependencies
- Optimize Dockerfile layer ordering to maximize cache hit rates
- Add .dockerignore to reduce build context size
- Implement build caching strategies and optimization techniques
- Add build performance monitoring and documentation

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Build Context Optimization

Reduce the size of the build context sent to Docker daemon to improve initial build setup time.

### 1.1: Create and optimize .dockerignore file

Create a comprehensive .dockerignore file to exclude unnecessary files from the build context.

- Create **.dockerignore** file in the project root directory
- Add common exclusions: `node_modules`, `.git`, `.md`, `.log`, `tmp/`, `test/`, `docs/`
- Add language-specific exclusions (e.g., `__pycache__`, `.pytest_cache` for Python)
- Add IDE and OS-specific files: `.vscode`, `.idea`, `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`
- Measure build context size before and after using `docker build --no-cache --progress=plain .`

### 1.2: Analyze current build context

Identify large files and directories unnecessarily included in the build context.

- Run `docker build --no-cache --progress=plain . 2>&1 | grep "transferring context"`
- Use `du -sh *` in project root to identify large directories
- Review current Dockerfile COPY/ADD statements to ensure only necessary files are copied
- Document findings in a **build-analysis.md** file

### Step 2: Dockerfile Layer Optimization

Restructure Dockerfile to maximize Docker layer caching effectiveness by ordering layers from least to most frequently changing.

### 2.1: Optimize package installation layers

Separate package management from application code to improve cache hit rates.

- Move package manager files (package.json, requirements.txt, Gemfile, etc.) COPY before application code
- Run package installation commands immediately after copying package files
- Combine related RUN commands using `&&` to reduce layer count
- Add `-no-cache` flags to package managers where appropriate (e.g., `apk add --no-cache`)

### 2.2: Restructure application code layers

Optimize the order of application code copying and building.

- Copy application code after dependency installation
- Separate frequently changing files (source code) from static files (config, assets)
- Use specific COPY commands instead of `COPY . .` where possible
- Group related operations in single RUN commands to minimize layers

### 2.3: Implement build argument optimization

Add build arguments to make builds more flexible and cacheable.

- Add ARG instructions for version numbers, build flags, and environment-specific values
- Use build arguments to conditionally include development vs production dependencies
- Add default values for all build arguments
- Update build scripts to pass appropriate build arguments

### Step 3: Multi-Stage Build Implementation

Implement multi-stage builds to separate build environment from runtime environment, reducing final image size and improving build efficiency.

### 3.1: Create build stage

Separate the build environment into its own stage with all build dependencies.

- Add `FROM base-image as builder` stage at the beginning of Dockerfile
- Install all build tools, compilers, and development dependencies in builder stage
- Perform all compilation, bundling, and build operations in builder stage
- Ensure build artifacts are created in predictable locations

### 3.2: Create production stage

Create a minimal production stage that only includes runtime dependencies and built artifacts.

- Add `FROM base-image as production` stage for the final image
- Install only runtime dependencies in production stage
- Use `COPY --from=builder` to copy built artifacts from builder stage
- Remove all unnecessary build tools and development dependencies

### 3.3: Add intermediate stages for optimization

Create additional stages for common operations that can be cached independently.

- Add `dependencies` stage for installing and caching dependencies
- Add `test` stage for running tests without affecting production build
- Add `assets` stage for processing static assets if applicable
- Ensure each stage has a clear, single responsibility

### Step 4: Advanced Caching Strategies

Implement advanced Docker build caching mechanisms to maximize cache utilization.

### 4.1: Implement BuildKit cache mounts

Use BuildKit cache mounts to persist package manager caches across builds.

- Add `# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1` at the top of Dockerfile
- Use `RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache` for package manager caches
- Implement cache mounts for language-specific caches (npm, pip, apt, etc.)
- Test cache mount effectiveness with repeated builds

### 4.2: Configure build cache optimization

Set up build cache configuration for optimal performance.

- Add `.dockerignore` entries for cache directories that should be mounted instead of copied
- Configure cache directory permissions and ownership
- Add cache warming strategies for CI/CD environments
- Document cache mount usage and benefits

### 4.3: Implement external cache sources

Configure external cache sources for CI/CD environments.

- Add support for registry-based build caches using `-cache-from` and `-cache-to`
- Configure build scripts to use external cache sources in CI/CD
- Add cache invalidation strategies for security updates
- Test external cache effectiveness in CI/CD pipeline

### Step 5: Build Script and Tooling Enhancement

Create optimized build scripts and tooling to support efficient Docker builds.

### 5.1: Create optimized build scripts

Develop build scripts that utilize all optimization features.

- Create **scripts/docker-build.sh** with optimized build commands
- Add support for build arguments, cache options, and target selection
- Include build time measurement and reporting
- Add validation for required build tools and Docker version

### 5.2: Add build performance monitoring

Implement monitoring to track build performance improvements.

- Add build time measurement to build scripts
- Create **build-metrics.json** to track historical build times
- Add build size reporting for each build stage
- Implement alerts for build time regressions

### 5.3: [NO-CODE-CHANGE] Document build optimization strategies

Create comprehensive documentation for the optimized build process.

- Create **docs/docker-build-optimization.md** with optimization strategies
- Document all build arguments and their purposes
- Add troubleshooting guide for common build issues
- Include performance benchmarks and expected build times

### Step 6: Testing and Validation

Implement comprehensive testing to ensure build optimizations don't break functionality.

### 6.1: Add build validation tests

Create tests to validate that optimized builds produce correct artifacts.

- Add **tests/docker/test_build.sh** to validate build success
- Test multi-stage build artifacts are correctly copied
- Validate that production image contains only necessary files
- Test build with and without cache to ensure consistency

### 6.2: Implement build performance tests

Create automated tests to monitor build performance.

- Add build time benchmarking in CI/CD pipeline
- Create performance regression tests
- Add image size validation tests
- Implement cache effectiveness measurement

### 6.3: Add integration tests for optimized images

Ensure optimized Docker images work correctly in all environments.

- Test optimized images in development environment
- Validate production image functionality
- Test images with different build arguments
- Verify security scanning still passes on optimized images

## Manual testing plan

- Build Docker image from scratch and measure total build time
- Rebuild image immediately and verify cache utilization improves build time by at least 50%
- Test multi-stage build by running `docker build --target=builder` and `docker build --target=production`
- Verify build context size reduction by comparing before and after .dockerignore implementation
- Test build scripts in both local and CI/CD environments
- Validate that optimized images start correctly and pass health checks
- Confirm that production images don't contain build tools or development dependencies
- Test build performance with different cache scenarios (no cache, partial cache, full cache)
