# Migrate Legacy APIs to Versioned Endpoints
Migrate existing unversioned API endpoints to a versioned API structure to support backward compatibility and future API evolution.

## Summary of changes
- Legacy APIs currently exist without version prefixes, making it difficult to introduce breaking changes
- Implement a versioned API structure with v1 as the initial version for existing endpoints
- Create middleware to handle version routing and maintain backward compatibility
- Update client integrations and documentation to reflect the new versioned structure
- Establish patterns for future API version management

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: API Analysis and Planning
Establish the foundation for API versioning by analyzing current endpoints and creating a migration strategy.

#### 1.1: Audit Current API Endpoints
Create a comprehensive inventory of all existing API endpoints to understand the scope of migration.
- Scan codebase for all route definitions in controllers, routers, and API configuration files
- Document each endpoint's HTTP method, path, parameters, request/response schemas
- Identify endpoints that are actively used by clients vs deprecated endpoints
- Create **api-inventory.md** in the **docs/** directory with the complete endpoint list
- Categorize endpoints by functionality (auth, users, orders, etc.) for organized migration

#### 1.2: Define Versioning Strategy
Establish the versioning approach and standards that will guide the migration process.
- Create **api-versioning-strategy.md** in **docs/** directory outlining version numbering scheme
- Define URL structure pattern (e.g., `/api/v1/users` vs `/v1/api/users`)
- Establish backward compatibility policy and deprecation timeline
- Document version header alternatives (Accept header, custom headers) as fallback options
- Define error response format for unsupported versions

#### 1.3: Create Migration Timeline
Develop a phased approach for migrating different API groups to minimize disruption.
- Create **migration-timeline.md** in **docs/** directory with migration phases
- Group related endpoints for simultaneous migration (e.g., all user-related endpoints)
- Define rollback procedures for each migration phase
- Establish communication plan for notifying API consumers of changes

### Step 2: Infrastructure Setup
Create the foundational components needed to support versioned APIs.

#### 2.1: Implement Version Detection Middleware
Create middleware to parse and validate API version information from requests.
- Create **middleware/version-middleware.js** (or appropriate language equivalent)
- Implement logic to extract version from URL path (e.g., `/api/v1/`)
- Add fallback to check `Accept` header for version specification
- Set default version (v1) for requests without explicit version
- Add version information to request context for downstream handlers
- Include comprehensive unit tests in **tests/middleware/version-middleware.test.js**

#### 2.2: Create Version Routing Infrastructure
Build the routing system that directs requests to appropriate versioned handlers.
- Create **routes/versioned-routes.js** to handle version-specific routing logic
- Implement route registration system that maps versions to handler functions
- Create base controller classes for each API version in **controllers/v1/** directory
- Add route validation to ensure all versioned endpoints are properly registered
- Create integration tests in **tests/routes/versioned-routes.test.js**

#### 2.3: Update API Configuration
Modify existing API configuration to support the new versioned structure.
- Update main router configuration to use version detection middleware
- Modify API base path configuration to include version prefix
- Update CORS configuration to handle versioned endpoints
- Modify rate limiting rules to work with versioned paths
- Update API documentation generation configuration for versioned endpoints

### Step 3: V1 API Implementation
Create the first version of the API by migrating existing endpoints to v1 structure.

#### 3.1: Create V1 Controllers
Migrate existing controller logic to versioned v1 controllers while maintaining identical functionality.
- Create **controllers/v1/** directory structure mirroring existing controllers
- Copy existing controller methods to v1 controllers without functional changes
- Update import statements and dependencies in v1 controllers
- Ensure all existing business logic remains unchanged in v1 implementation
- Add unit tests for v1 controllers in **tests/controllers/v1/**

#### 3.2: Implement V1 Routes
Create route definitions for v1 endpoints that map to the new v1 controllers.
- Create **routes/v1/** directory with route files for each API group
- Define v1 routes with `/api/v1/` prefix pointing to v1 controllers
- Maintain exact same endpoint behavior and response format as legacy endpoints
- Update middleware chain for v1 routes to include authentication and validation
- Create route-level tests in **tests/routes/v1/**

#### 3.3: Add V1 Request/Response Validation
Implement input validation and response formatting for v1 endpoints.
- Create **schemas/v1/** directory with request/response schema definitions
- Implement validation middleware for v1 endpoints using existing validation rules
- Ensure response format matches exactly with legacy API responses
- Add error handling that maintains backward compatibility
- Create validation tests in **tests/schemas/v1/**

### Step 4: Legacy API Compatibility Layer
Implement a compatibility layer that allows legacy endpoints to coexist with versioned ones.

#### 4.1: Create Legacy Route Wrapper
Build a wrapper that routes legacy API calls to v1 implementations.
- Create **routes/legacy-wrapper.js** that maps legacy paths to v1 handlers
- Implement path translation logic (e.g., `/api/users` â†’ `/api/v1/users`)
- Ensure all legacy endpoints continue to work without client changes
- Add request/response transformation if needed for backward compatibility
- Create comprehensive tests in **tests/routes/legacy-wrapper.test.js**

#### 4.2: Add Deprecation Headers
Implement deprecation warnings for legacy endpoint usage.
- Modify legacy wrapper to add `Deprecation` and `Sunset` headers to responses
- Include `Link` header pointing to v1 documentation
- Add logging for legacy endpoint usage to track migration progress
- Create configuration for deprecation timeline and warning messages
- Update monitoring to track legacy vs versioned endpoint usage

#### 4.3: Update Error Handling
Ensure error responses are consistent between legacy and versioned endpoints.
- Update error handling middleware to work with both legacy and versioned routes
- Maintain existing error response format for backward compatibility
- Add version information to error logs for debugging
- Create error response tests covering both legacy and v1 endpoints

### Step 5: Documentation and Client Updates
Update documentation and prepare clients for the versioned API structure.

#### 5.1: Update API Documentation
Create comprehensive documentation for the new versioned API structure.
- Update **README.md** with versioned API usage examples
- Create **docs/api/v1/** directory with detailed v1 endpoint documentation
- Update OpenAPI/Swagger specifications to include version information
- Add migration guide in **docs/migration-guide.md** for API consumers
- Include examples showing both legacy and v1 endpoint usage

#### 5.2: Update Client SDK Examples
Modify existing client examples and SDKs to demonstrate versioned API usage.
- Update code examples in **examples/** directory to use v1 endpoints
- Create client configuration examples showing version specification
- Update any existing SDK code to support version parameter
- Add backward compatibility examples for gradual client migration
- Create client migration checklist in **docs/client-migration.md**

#### 5.3: Create Monitoring and Analytics
Implement tracking to monitor the migration progress and API usage patterns.
- Add metrics collection for legacy vs versioned endpoint usage
- Create dashboard queries to track migration progress by endpoint
- Implement alerting for unexpected legacy API usage spikes
- Add logging to track which clients are using which API versions
- Create monitoring documentation in **docs/api-monitoring.md**

## Manual testing plan
- Test all legacy endpoints continue to work exactly as before with same response format
- Verify new v1 endpoints return identical responses to their legacy counterparts
- Test version detection middleware correctly routes requests based on URL path
- Verify deprecation headers are properly added to legacy endpoint responses
- Test error scenarios return consistent error format across legacy and v1 endpoints
- Validate that authentication and authorization work identically for both endpoint types
- Test rate limiting and other middleware functions correctly with versioned paths
- Verify API documentation accurately reflects both legacy and v1 endpoint behavior
- Test client examples work with both legacy and versioned endpoint configurations
