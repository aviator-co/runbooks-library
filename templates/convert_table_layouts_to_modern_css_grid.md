# Convert Table Layouts to Modern CSS Grid
Replace legacy HTML table-based layouts with semantic HTML and CSS Grid for improved accessibility, maintainability, and responsive design.

## Summary of changes
- Audit existing codebase to identify all table-based layouts used for non-tabular data presentation
- Create reusable CSS Grid utility classes and components to replace common table layout patterns
- Systematically convert table layouts to semantic HTML with CSS Grid styling
- Update responsive breakpoints and ensure cross-browser compatibility
- Maintain visual consistency while improving code semantics and accessibility

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Analysis and Planning
Comprehensive audit of current table usage and creation of conversion strategy.

#### 1.1: Audit Table Usage Across Codebase
Identify all HTML tables and categorize them by usage type (layout vs data presentation).
- Search codebase for `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>` elements using grep or IDE search
- Document each table's location, purpose, and current styling in **audit-results.md**
- Categorize tables as: data tables (keep as tables), layout tables (convert to grid), hybrid cases
- Take screenshots of current visual appearance for comparison testing
- Identify shared table patterns that can be converted to reusable components

#### 1.2: Create CSS Grid Conversion Strategy
Define the approach for converting different table layout patterns to CSS Grid.
- Document common table layout patterns found in audit (2-column, 3-column, nested tables, etc.)
- Design CSS Grid equivalents for each pattern in **grid-conversion-strategy.md**
- Define naming conventions for new CSS Grid utility classes
- Plan responsive breakpoint strategy for each layout pattern
- Identify dependencies between components that may affect conversion order

#### 1.3: Establish Browser Support Requirements
Document target browser support and fallback strategies for CSS Grid.
- Research CSS Grid support requirements based on project's browser support matrix
- Document fallback strategies for unsupported browsers in **browser-support-plan.md**
- Identify any polyfills or progressive enhancement approaches needed
- Plan testing strategy across different browsers and devices

### Step 2: Foundation Setup
Create the base CSS Grid utilities and testing infrastructure.

#### 2.1: Create CSS Grid Utility Classes
Develop reusable CSS Grid utility classes for common layout patterns.
- Create **src/styles/grid-utilities.css** with base grid container classes
- Implement responsive grid utilities (.grid-2-col, .grid-3-col, .grid-auto-fit, etc.)
- Add gap utilities (.gap-sm, .gap-md, .gap-lg) for consistent spacing
- Create alignment utilities (.items-center, .justify-center, etc.)
- Add CSS custom properties for consistent grid values and breakpoints

#### 2.2: Set Up Visual Regression Testing
Implement automated visual testing to catch layout regressions during conversion.
- Install and configure visual regression testing tool (Percy, Chromatic, or similar)
- Create baseline screenshots of all pages containing table layouts
- Set up CI pipeline integration for visual regression tests
- Document visual testing workflow in **visual-testing-guide.md**
- Create test scenarios for different viewport sizes and browser combinations

#### 2.3: Create Grid Component Templates
Build reusable component templates for common table-to-grid conversions.
- Create **src/components/grid-layouts/** directory structure

- Implement **FormGrid.vue/jsx** component for form field layouts
- Implement **ContentGrid.vue/jsx** component for content area layouts
- Add comprehensive prop interfaces and documentation for each component

### Step 3: Simple Layout Conversions
Convert straightforward table layouts with minimal dependencies.

#### 3.1: Convert Simple Two-Column Layouts
Replace basic two-column table layouts with CSS Grid equivalents.
- Identify all simple two-column table layouts from audit results
- Replace `<table><tr><td>` structure with semantic `<div>` elements
- Apply `.grid-2-col` utility class and appropriate gap spacing
- Update any associated CSS selectors that targeted table elements
- Test responsive behavior and adjust breakpoints as needed

#### 3.2: Convert Card Grid Layouts
Transform table-based card or tile layouts to CSS Grid.
- Locate table layouts used for displaying card-like content
- Replace with semantic HTML using `<article>`, `<section>`, or `<div>` elements
- Implement CSS Grid with `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax())` pattern
- Ensure proper spacing and alignment using grid gap properties
- Add responsive behavior for different screen sizes

#### 3.3: Update Form Field Layouts
Convert table-based form layouts to CSS Grid for better accessibility.
- Identify forms using tables for label and input field alignment
- Replace with proper form markup using `<label>` and form control elements
- Apply CSS Grid for label-input alignment while maintaining visual consistency
- Ensure proper form accessibility with correct label associations
- Test form validation and interaction behavior

### Step 4: Complex Layout Conversions
Handle more complex table layouts with nested structures and dependencies.

#### 4.1: Convert Nested Table Layouts
Transform complex nested table structures to CSS Grid with subgrids or nested grids.
- Identify tables with nested table structures from audit
- Design CSS Grid approach using CSS Subgrid where supported, nested grids as fallback
- Convert outer table structure first, then inner nested tables
- Maintain visual hierarchy and spacing relationships
- Test complex responsive behavior and adjust grid areas as needed

#### 4.2: Convert Dashboard and Admin Layouts
Replace table-based dashboard and administrative interface layouts.
- Identify dashboard pages using tables for layout structure
- Design CSS Grid template areas for header, sidebar, main content, and footer regions
- Convert table-based widget layouts to CSS Grid containers
- Ensure proper responsive behavior for mobile and tablet viewports
- Update any JavaScript that depends on table DOM structure

#### 4.3: Handle Dynamic Content Layouts
Convert table layouts that contain dynamically generated content.
- Identify tables populated by JavaScript or server-side rendering
- Update template files to generate semantic HTML instead of table markup
- Modify JavaScript code that manipulates table DOM elements
- Ensure CSS Grid classes are properly applied to dynamic content
- Test with various content lengths and empty states

### Step 5: Data Table Preservation
Ensure actual data tables remain as tables with improved styling.

#### 5.1: Enhance Legitimate Data Tables
Improve styling and accessibility of tables that should remain as tables.
