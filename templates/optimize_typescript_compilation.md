# Optimize TypeScript compilation
Analyze current TypeScript build performance and implement optimizations to reduce compilation time and improve developer experience.

## Summary of changes
- Audit current TypeScript configuration and build performance to identify bottlenecks
- Implement incremental compilation and build caching strategies
- Optimize TypeScript compiler options and project structure for faster builds
- Add build performance monitoring and establish baseline metrics

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Performance Analysis and Baseline
Establish current build performance metrics and identify optimization opportunities.

#### 1.1: Build Performance Audit
Create comprehensive analysis of current TypeScript compilation performance and configuration.
- Create **docs/typescript-optimization-audit.md** documenting current build times, configuration analysis, and bottlenecks
- Run `tsc --build --verbose` and document compilation times for each project/package
- Analyze **tsconfig.json** files across the codebase for suboptimal configurations
- Document current project structure and dependencies that may impact build performance
- Identify large files, complex type definitions, and circular dependencies affecting compilation

#### 1.2: Baseline Metrics Collection
Implement tooling to measure and track TypeScript compilation performance over time.
- Add **scripts/measure-build-time.js** script to collect detailed build metrics
- Modify **package.json** to include build measurement commands
- Create **build-metrics.json** template for storing historical build performance data
- Update CI configuration to collect and store build time metrics
- Document baseline metrics in the audit document

### Step 2: TypeScript Configuration Optimization
Optimize TypeScript compiler options and project configuration for improved performance.

#### 2.1: Compiler Options Optimization
Update TypeScript configuration files to use performance-optimized compiler options.
- Update **tsconfig.json** to enable `incremental: true` and configure `tsBuildInfoFile`
- Set `skipLibCheck: true` to skip type checking of declaration files
- Configure `moduleResolution: "node"` and optimize `baseUrl`/`paths` mappings
- Enable `isolatedModules: true` for better parallelization support
- Update `target` and `module` settings to match deployment requirements

#### 2.2: Project Structure Optimization
Restructure TypeScript project configuration to leverage project references and composite builds.
- Create **tsconfig.build.json** for optimized production builds
- Implement TypeScript project references in **tsconfig.json** for multi-package projects
- Configure `composite: true` for packages that should be referenced by others
- Update build scripts in **package.json** to use `tsc --build` for incremental compilation
- Modify **webpack.config.js** or build tools to respect TypeScript build info

### Step 3: Build Caching and Incremental Compilation
Implement advanced caching strategies to minimize redundant compilation work.

#### 3.1: Local Build Caching
Configure local development environment for optimal incremental builds.
- Update **.gitignore** to exclude TypeScript build info files appropriately
- Configure **tsconfig.json** with optimal `outDir` structure for incremental builds
- Implement build cache warming script in **scripts/warm-build-cache.js**
- Update development server configuration to leverage TypeScript incremental compilation
- Document cache management procedures in **docs/development-setup.md**

#### 3.2: CI/CD Build Caching
Implement build caching in continuous integration pipeline for faster CI builds.
- Update **CI configuration** (e.g., **.github/workflows/ci.yml**) to cache TypeScript build artifacts
- Configure cache keys based on TypeScript configuration and source file hashes
- Implement build artifact sharing between CI jobs
- Add cache hit/miss reporting to build logs
- Update deployment scripts to handle cached build artifacts

### Step 4: Advanced Optimization Techniques
Implement advanced TypeScript compilation optimizations and tooling improvements.

#### 4.1: Type-Only Import Optimization
Optimize import statements and type definitions to reduce compilation overhead.
- Audit codebase for opportunities to use `import type` statements
- Update import statements in **src/** directories to use type-only imports where appropriate
- Configure ESLint rules in **.eslintrc.js** to enforce type-only imports
- Update **tsconfig.json** with `importsNotUsedAsValues: "error"` for better tree-shaking
- Create automated script **scripts/optimize-imports.js** to identify optimization opportunities

#### 4.2: Build Tool Integration
Integrate optimized TypeScript compilation with existing build tools and development workflow.
- Update **webpack.config.js** to use `ts-loader` with `transpileOnly: true` for development
- Configure **fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin** for parallel type checking
- Update **jest.config.js** to use `ts-jest` with optimized TypeScript compilation
- Modify **rollup.config.js** or other bundlers to leverage TypeScript build cache
- Update development server configuration for faster hot module replacement

### Step 5: Monitoring and Maintenance
Establish ongoing monitoring and maintenance procedures for TypeScript build performance.

#### 5.1: Performance Monitoring Setup
Implement continuous monitoring of TypeScript compilation performance.
- Create **scripts/build-performance-monitor.js** for automated performance tracking
- Update CI pipeline to track and report build time regressions
- Implement performance budgets and alerts for build time increases
- Create dashboard or reporting mechanism for build performance trends
- Document performance monitoring procedures in **docs/build-monitoring.md**

#### 5.2: Maintenance Documentation
Create comprehensive documentation for maintaining optimized TypeScript builds.
- Update **README.md** with optimized build commands and developer setup instructions
- Create **docs/typescript-build-optimization.md** with detailed optimization guide
- Document troubleshooting procedures for build performance issues
- Create maintenance checklist for periodic TypeScript configuration reviews
- Update contributing guidelines to include build performance considerations

## Manual testing plan
- Measure build times before and after each optimization step to verify improvements
- Test incremental compilation by making small changes and verifying only affected files recompile
- Verify all existing functionality works correctly after configuration changes
- Test development server hot reload performance with optimized configuration
- Validate CI/CD pipeline builds successfully with caching enabled
- Confirm type checking accuracy is maintained with performance optimizations
- Test build performance across different development environments and machines
- Verify build artifacts are correctly generated and deployable after optimizations
