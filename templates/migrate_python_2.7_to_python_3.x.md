# Python 2.7 to Python 3.x Migration Runbook
A comprehensive migration plan to upgrade the codebase from Python 2.7 to Python 3.x while maintaining functionality and test coverage.

## Summary of changes
- Current codebase is running on Python 2.7 which reached end-of-life in January 2020
- Migration involves syntax updates, library compatibility changes, and Unicode handling modifications
- Plan includes compatibility layer setup, gradual migration, and thorough testing at each phase
- Final migration will remove Python 2.7 support and optimize for Python 3.x features

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Assessment and Planning
Initial analysis and preparation phase to understand the scope of migration work.

#### 1.1: Codebase Analysis and Compatibility Assessment
Analyze the current codebase to identify Python 2/3 compatibility issues and create a comprehensive migration strategy document.
- Run **modernize** or **2to3** tools in analysis mode to identify potential issues without making changes
- Create **`migration_analysis.md`** document listing all identified compatibility issues categorized by severity
- Audit all third-party dependencies in **`requirements.txt`** and **`setup.py`** for Python 3 compatibility
- Document current test coverage and identify areas that need additional testing during migration
- Create **`migration_timeline.md`** with estimated effort for each identified issue

#### 1.2: Development Environment Setup
Set up dual Python environment support to enable gradual migration testing.
- Install Python 3.x (latest stable version) alongside existing Python 2.7 in development environments
- Create **`requirements-py3.txt`** with Python 3 compatible versions of all dependencies
- Update **`tox.ini`** to include both Python 2.7 and Python 3.x test environments
- Modify **`Makefile`** or build scripts to support testing against both Python versions
- Update **`.gitignore`** to exclude Python 3 specific cache directories (**`__pycache__`**)

#### 1.3: CI/CD Pipeline Enhancement
Update continuous integration to test both Python versions during the transition period.
- Modify **`.travis.yml`**, **`.github/workflows`**, or equivalent CI configuration to test both Python 2.7 and 3.x
- Update Docker configurations in **`Dockerfile`** and **`docker-compose.yml`** to support both versions
- Create separate test jobs for Python 2.7 and Python 3.x with appropriate dependency sets
- Configure CI to run both versions in parallel and require both to pass

### Step 2: Foundation Migration
Core infrastructure changes to support Python 2/3 compatibility.

#### 2.1: Import and Compatibility Layer Setup
Implement compatibility imports and future statements to enable gradual migration.
- Add **`from __future__ import print_function, division, absolute_import, unicode_literals`** to all Python files
- Install and configure **`six`** library for Python 2/3 compatibility utilities
- Update **`requirements.txt`** and **`requirements-py3.txt`** to include **`six`** dependency
- Create **`compat.py`** module with common compatibility functions and imports
- Update all files to use compatibility imports for renamed modules (e.g., **`urllib`**, **`configparser`**)

#### 2.2: String and Unicode Handling Migration
Address string and Unicode compatibility issues across the codebase.
- Replace all **`unicode()`** calls with **`six.text_type()`** or appropriate **`six`** utilities
- Update string literal definitions to use **`u''`** prefix where Unicode is required
- Replace **`basestring`** checks with **`six.string_types`**
- Update file I/O operations to explicitly specify text/binary mode and encoding
- Modify string formatting to use **`.format()`** method instead of **`%`** formatting where applicable

#### 2.3: Print Statement to Function Migration
Convert all print statements to print function calls.
- Replace all **`print "text"`** statements with **`print("text")`** function calls
- Update print statements with multiple arguments to use proper function syntax
- Modify print statements with **`>>file`** redirection to use **`file=`** parameter
- Update any code that captures print output to work with function-based printing
- Run tests to ensure all print conversions work correctly in both Python versions

### Step 3: Core Language Feature Migration
Update language-specific features and built-in function usage.

#### 3.1: Iterator and Dictionary Method Updates
Migrate dictionary methods and iterator usage for Python 3 compatibility.
- Replace **`.iteritems()`**, **`.iterkeys()`**, **`.itervalues()`** with **`six.iteritems()`**, **`six.iterkeys()`**, **`six.itervalues()`**
- Update **`.items()`**, **`.keys()`**, **`.values()`** usage where list behavior is required using **`list()`** wrapper
- Replace **`dict.has_key()`** with **`in`** operator or **`.get()`** method
- Update **`xrange()`** usage to **`range()`** with **`six.moves.range`** for compatibility
- Modify any code that depends on dictionary ordering to use **`collections.OrderedDict`** if order matters

#### 3.2: Exception Handling Syntax Updates
Update exception handling syntax to Python 3 compatible format.
- Replace **`except Exception, e:`** syntax with **`except Exception as e:`**
- Update **`raise Exception, message`** to **`raise Exception(message)`**
- Review and update any **`sys.exc_info()`** usage for Python 3 compatibility
- Modify custom exception classes to properly inherit from **`Exception`**
- Update exception chaining where applicable using **`raise ... from ...`** syntax

#### 3.3: Built-in Function and Method Updates
Update usage of built-in functions that changed behavior between Python versions.
- Replace **`raw_input()`** with **`six.moves.input`** for cross-version compatibility
- Update **`map()`**, **`filter()`**, **`zip()`** usage to handle iterator vs list differences
- Replace **`reduce()`** with **`functools.reduce()`** and add appropriate imports
- Update **`cmp`** parameter usage in sorting functions with **`key`** parameter and **`functools.cmp_to_key()`**
- Modify any **`execfile()`** usage to use **`exec(open().read())`** pattern

### Step 4: Library and Dependency Migration
Update third-party libraries and handle import changes.

#### 4.1: Standard Library Import Updates
Update imports for standard library modules that were reorganized in Python 3.
- Replace **`import ConfigParser`** with **`six.moves.configparser`**

#### 4.2: Third-Party Library Version Updates
Upgrade third-party dependencies to versions that support Python 3.
- Update **`requirements.txt`** with Python 3 compatible versions of all dependencies
- Test each dependency upgrade individually to identify breaking changes
- Update any deprecated API usage in third-party libraries based on their migration guides
- Replace any Python 2 only libraries with Python 3 compatible alternatives
