# Optimize Maven dependency resolution
Analyze current Maven dependency structure and implement optimizations to reduce build times and resolve version conflicts.

## Summary of changes
- Audit current dependency tree to identify redundant, conflicting, and unused dependencies
- Implement dependency management best practices including BOM usage and version centralization
- Configure Maven plugins for better dependency resolution and conflict detection
- Add automated dependency analysis tools to prevent future dependency bloat

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Dependency Analysis and Documentation
Establish baseline understanding of current dependency state and identify optimization opportunities.

#### 1.1: Generate comprehensive dependency analysis report
Create a detailed analysis of the current Maven dependency structure to identify optimization opportunities.
- Run `mvn dependency:tree -Dverbose` on all modules and capture output to **dependency-tree-analysis.md**
- Run `mvn dependency:analyze` to identify unused and undeclared dependencies, document findings in **dependency-analysis-report.md**
- Execute `mvn dependency:resolve-sources dependency:resolve` to identify missing source attachments
- Create **docs/dependency-optimization-baseline.md** with current build times, dependency counts, and identified issues

#### 1.2: Identify version conflicts and redundancies
Analyze dependency conflicts and create resolution strategy document.
- Run `mvn dependency:tree -Dverbose | grep "omitted for conflict"` to identify all version conflicts
- Document all conflicting dependencies in **docs/dependency-conflicts.md** with current versions and recommended resolutions
- Use `mvn dependency:tree -Dincludes=*:*:*:*:compile` to identify duplicate dependencies across different scopes
- Create **docs/dependency-deduplication-plan.md** listing redundant dependencies and removal strategy

### Step 2: Dependency Management Infrastructure
Implement centralized dependency management and version control mechanisms.

#### 2.1: Create parent POM with dependency management
Establish centralized dependency version management through parent POM configuration.
- Create or update **parent-pom/pom.xml** with `<dependencyManagement>` section containing all common dependencies
- Add version properties for all major dependency groups (Spring, Jackson, Apache Commons, etc.) in `<properties>` section
- Configure **maven-dependency-plugin** version 3.6.0+ in `<pluginManagement>` with analyze and tree goals
- Update all child module POMs to inherit from parent and remove explicit version declarations

#### 2.2: Implement Bill of Materials (BOM) imports
Integrate industry-standard BOMs to ensure consistent dependency versions across the project.
- Add Spring Boot BOM import in parent POM's `<dependencyManagement>` section if using Spring Boot
- Import relevant platform BOMs (e.g., `spring-cloud-dependencies`, `junit-bom`) based on project requirements
- Configure BOM imports with `<scope>import</scope>` and `<type>pom</type>` in dependency management
- Update child POMs to remove version specifications for dependencies covered by imported BOMs

#### 2.3: Configure Maven dependency plugin with analysis goals
Set up automated dependency analysis and validation as part of the build process.
- Configure **maven-dependency-plugin** in parent POM with `analyze-only` goal bound to `verify` phase
- Set `failOnWarning=true` for unused dependency detection in plugin configuration
- Add `ignoredUnusedDeclaredDependencies` configuration for legitimate compile-only dependencies
- Configure `analyze-duplicate` goal to detect and fail on duplicate dependencies

### Step 3: Dependency Cleanup and Optimization
Remove unused dependencies and resolve version conflicts based on analysis findings.

#### 3.1: Remove unused and redundant dependencies
Clean up dependency declarations based on analysis findings to reduce build overhead.
- Remove all dependencies identified as unused by `mvn dependency:analyze` from respective **pom.xml** files
- Eliminate transitive dependency declarations that are already provided by other direct dependencies
- Remove duplicate dependency declarations across modules by centralizing them in parent POM
- Run `mvn clean compile test` after each module cleanup to ensure build stability

#### 3.2: Resolve version conflicts
Implement explicit version management for conflicting dependencies to ensure consistent resolution.
- Add explicit dependency declarations in parent POM's `<dependencyManagement>` for all conflicting dependencies
- Choose latest compatible versions based on compatibility matrix documented in **docs/dependency-conflicts.md**
- Add exclusions in child POMs where necessary to prevent unwanted transitive dependencies
- Test critical functionality after each conflict resolution to ensure compatibility

#### 3.3: Optimize dependency scopes
Adjust dependency scopes to minimize runtime classpath and improve build performance.
- Change dependencies used only in tests from `compile` to `test` scope in all **pom.xml** files
- Move build-time only dependencies (annotations, code generation) to `provided` scope
- Ensure runtime dependencies are explicitly declared with `runtime` scope where appropriate
- Validate scope changes with `mvn dependency:analyze` to ensure no missing dependencies

### Step 4: Build Performance Optimization
Configure Maven settings and plugins for optimal dependency resolution performance.

#### 4.1: Configure Maven resolver settings
Optimize Maven's dependency resolution mechanism for faster builds and better caching.
- Update **settings.xml** or create project-specific **.mvn/maven.config** with resolver configuration
- Enable parallel dependency resolution with `-Dmaven.resolver.transport=wagon` if using Maven 3.8+
- Configure local repository cleanup with `maven-dependency-plugin` `purge-local-repository` goal
- Set up dependency caching optimization with `maven.repo.local` property for CI/CD environments

#### 4.2: Implement dependency convergence validation
Add build-time validation to prevent future dependency conflicts and ensure version consistency.
- Configure **maven-enforcer-plugin** version 3.3.0+ in parent POM with `DependencyConvergence` rule
- Add `RequireUpperBoundDeps` rule to enforce consistent dependency versions across all modules
- Configure `bannedDependencies` rule to prevent inclusion of known problematic dependency versions
- Set up `requireMavenVersion` and `requireJavaVersion` rules for build environment consistency

#### 4.3: Set up automated dependency updates
Implement tooling for ongoing dependency maintenance and security updates.
- Configure **versions-maven-plugin** version 2.16.0+ with goals for dependency and plugin updates
- Add **maven-dependency-check-plugin** for security vulnerability scanning of dependencies
- Create **scripts/update-dependencies.sh** script that runs `versions:display-dependency-updates`
- Set up Maven wrapper with **mvnw** to ensure consistent Maven version across development environments

## Manual testing plan
- Execute full build with `mvn clean install` and verify build time improvement compared to baseline
- Run application startup tests to ensure no runtime ClassNotFoundException or dependency conflicts
- Perform integration tests to validate that all features work correctly with optimized dependencies
- Test dependency resolution in offline mode with `mvn -o clean compile` to verify local repository completeness
- Validate that `mvn dependency:analyze` reports no unused dependencies and minimal warnings
- Check that `mvn enforcer:enforce` passes without dependency convergence violations
- Verify that new dependency additions trigger appropriate warnings or failures through enforcer rules
