# Optimize Webpack Bundle Splitting
Analyze current bundle structure and implement strategic code splitting to reduce initial bundle size and improve loading performance.

## Summary of changes
- Current webpack configuration likely uses default splitting which may not be optimal for the application structure
- Large vendor libraries and application code are bundled together causing slower initial page loads
- Implement strategic bundle splitting with separate chunks for vendors, common code, and route-based splitting
- Add bundle analysis tooling to monitor and maintain optimal bundle sizes over time

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Analysis and Baseline
Establish current bundle analysis capabilities and document baseline performance metrics.

#### 1.1: Add Bundle Analysis Tools
Install and configure webpack-bundle-analyzer to visualize current bundle composition and identify optimization opportunities.
- Install `webpack-bundle-analyzer` as a dev dependency: `npm install --save-dev webpack-bundle-analyzer`
- Add analyzer script to **package.json**: `"analyze": "webpack-bundle-analyzer dist/static/js/*.js"`
- Create baseline bundle analysis report by running `npm run build && npm run analyze`
- Take screenshots of current bundle visualization for comparison

#### 1.2: Document Current Bundle Metrics
Create comprehensive documentation of existing bundle performance to track improvements.
- Create **docs/bundle-optimization.md** file in the repository
- Document current bundle sizes, number of chunks, and loading times
- Record First Contentful Paint (FCP) and Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) metrics
- List top 10 largest modules and their sizes from bundle analyzer

#### 1.3: Audit Application Dependencies
Analyze dependency usage patterns to inform splitting strategy.
- Review **package.json** and identify large vendor libraries (React, lodash, moment, etc.)
- Document which vendor libraries are used across multiple routes vs single routes
- Identify application modules that are imported in multiple places
- Create dependency usage matrix in **docs/bundle-optimization.md**

### Step 2: Configure Basic Code Splitting
Implement fundamental webpack optimizations for vendor and common code separation.

#### 2.1: Update Webpack Configuration for Vendor Splitting
Configure webpack to separate vendor libraries from application code for better caching.
- Modify **webpack.config.js** or **webpack.prod.js** to add `optimization.splitChunks` configuration
- Create `vendors` chunk for node_modules dependencies with `test: /[\\/]node_modules[\\/]/`
- Set `chunks: 'all'` to enable splitting for both sync and async imports
- Configure `cacheGroups` with appropriate priority settings

#### 2.2: Implement Common Code Splitting
Extract shared application code into separate chunks to avoid duplication.
- Add `common` cache group in splitChunks configuration for shared application modules
- Set `minChunks: 2` to extract modules used by at least 2 chunks
- Configure `priority` to ensure proper chunk hierarchy (vendors > common > default)
- Set appropriate `maxSize` limits to prevent overly large chunks

#### 2.3: Configure Chunk Naming and Output
Establish consistent naming conventions for generated chunks to improve debugging and caching.
- Update `output.chunkFilename` to include content hash for cache busting
- Configure meaningful names for named chunks using `optimization.splitChunks.cacheGroups[].name`
- Add `optimization.moduleIds: 'deterministic'` for consistent module IDs
- Update **index.html** template if needed to handle multiple script tags

### Step 3: Implement Route-Based Splitting
Add dynamic imports for route-based code splitting to reduce initial bundle size.

#### 3.1: Convert Route Components to Dynamic Imports
Transform static route imports to dynamic imports using React.lazy or equivalent.
- Identify all route components in **src/routes** or routing configuration
- Replace static imports with `React.lazy(() => import('./Component'))` syntax
- Wrap route components with `Suspense` boundary and appropriate fallback UI
- Update routing configuration to handle lazy-loaded components

#### 3.2: Add Loading States and Error Boundaries
Implement proper loading and error handling for dynamically imported components.
- Create reusable loading component in **src/components/Loading.jsx**
- Implement error boundary component in **src/components/ErrorBoundary.jsx**
- Update route-level Suspense boundaries to use consistent loading states
- Add error boundaries around lazy-loaded route components

#### 3.3: Configure Webpack for Dynamic Imports
Optimize webpack configuration for dynamic import handling and chunk naming.
- Add `webpackChunkName` comments to dynamic imports for meaningful chunk names
- Configure `optimization.splitChunks.chunks: 'all'` to handle async chunks
- Set `maxAsyncRequests` and `maxInitialRequests` limits to prevent excessive splitting
- Update `output.publicPath` if needed for proper chunk loading

### Step 4: Advanced Optimization
Implement sophisticated splitting strategies for large vendor libraries and preloading.

#### 4.1: Split Large Vendor Libraries
Separate large vendor libraries into individual chunks for granular caching control.
- Create specific cache groups for large libraries like React, lodash, moment in splitChunks config
- Use `test` regex to match specific node_modules packages: `test: /[\\/]node_modules[\\/](react|react-dom)[\\/]/`
- Set higher priority for specific vendor chunks to override default vendor grouping
- Configure appropriate `minSize` and `maxSize` limits for vendor chunks

#### 4.2: Implement Preloading Strategy
Add intelligent preloading for critical route chunks to improve perceived performance.
- Identify critical user journeys and frequently accessed routes
- Add `webpackPreload: true` comments to critical dynamic imports
- Implement route-based prefetching using `webpackPrefetch: true` for likely next routes
- Add intersection observer-based prefetching for route links in viewport

#### 4.3: Configure Runtime Chunk Optimization
Optimize webpack runtime and manifest handling for better caching.
- Enable `optimization.runtimeChunk: 'single'` to extract webpack runtime
- Configure `optimization.splitChunks.cacheGroups.default.minChunks` appropriately
- Set `optimization.usedExports: true` and `sideEffects: false` for tree shaking
- Update build process to handle multiple entry chunks if applicable

### Step 5: Performance Monitoring and Validation
Establish monitoring and validation processes to ensure optimizations are effective.

#### 5.1: Add Performance Metrics Collection
Implement tooling to track bundle performance metrics over time.
- Install and configure `speed-measure-webpack-plugin` to track build performance
- Add bundle size tracking script in **scripts/bundle-size-check.js**
- Create GitHub Actions workflow or CI step to track bundle size changes
- Set up alerts for bundle size regressions above defined thresholds

#### 5.2: Update Build and Deployment Process
Modify build pipeline to accommodate new bundle structure and validation.
- Update build scripts in **package.json** to generate and validate bundle reports
- Modify deployment configuration to handle multiple chunks and proper caching headers
- Add bundle analysis step to CI/CD pipeline with size comparison reports
- Update any CDN or static asset serving configuration for new chunk structure

#### 5.3: Create Bundle Monitoring Dashboard
Establish ongoing monitoring and alerting for bundle performance.
- Update **docs/bundle-optimization.md** with new metrics and comparison charts
- Create automated bundle size reporting in pull request comments
- Set up performance budgets using webpack-bundle-analyzer or similar tools
- Document bundle splitting strategy and maintenance procedures for team

## Manual testing plan
- Load application in browser and verify all routes load correctly with new chunk structure
- Check browser network tab to confirm separate vendor, common, and route chunks are loading
- Test application functionality across different routes to ensure no missing dependencies
- Verify loading states appear appropriately during route transitions
- Test application with slow 3G throttling to confirm improved initial load performance
- Compare before/after bundle analyzer reports to validate size reductions
- Check that browser caching works correctly by refreshing pages and observing network requests
- Test error boundaries by temporarily breaking a dynamic import to ensure graceful fallback
