# Migrate Polling to WebSocket Connections
Replace HTTP polling mechanisms with real-time WebSocket connections to improve performance and reduce server load.

## Summary of changes
- Current system uses HTTP polling for real-time updates causing high server load and latency
- Implement WebSocket server infrastructure with connection management and authentication
- Replace client-side polling logic with WebSocket event handlers
- Add fallback mechanisms for environments where WebSockets are not supported
- Update monitoring and logging to track WebSocket connections and performance metrics

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Infrastructure Setup
Establish the foundational WebSocket infrastructure and connection management system.

#### 1.1: WebSocket Server Implementation
Create the core WebSocket server with basic connection handling and authentication.
- Create **src/websocket/server.js** with WebSocket server initialization using ws library
- Implement connection authentication using existing JWT token validation
- Add connection lifecycle management (connect, disconnect, error handling)
- Create **src/websocket/connectionManager.js** to track active connections with user mapping
- Add environment configuration for WebSocket port and settings in **config/websocket.js**

#### 1.2: WebSocket Middleware and Security
Implement security layers and middleware for WebSocket connections.
- Add CORS configuration for WebSocket connections in server setup
- Implement rate limiting middleware to prevent connection abuse
- Add connection heartbeat/ping-pong mechanism to detect dead connections
- Create **src/websocket/middleware/auth.js** for WebSocket-specific authentication
- Add SSL/TLS support configuration for secure WebSocket connections (WSS)

#### 1.3: Message Protocol Design
Define the standardized message format and protocol for WebSocket communication.
- Create **src/websocket/protocol.js** defining message types and structure
- Implement message validation schema using JSON schema or similar
- Add message routing system to handle different event types
- Create error response format and error code definitions
- Document the WebSocket API protocol in **docs/websocket-api.md**

### Step 2: Client-Side WebSocket Implementation
Build the client-side WebSocket connection and event handling system.

#### 2.1: WebSocket Client Library
Create a robust client-side WebSocket wrapper with reconnection logic.
- Create **src/client/websocket/client.js** with WebSocket connection management
- Implement automatic reconnection with exponential backoff strategy
- Add connection state management (connecting, connected, disconnected, error)
- Create event emitter system for handling incoming WebSocket messages
- Add client-side authentication token refresh mechanism for WebSocket connections

#### 2.2: Fallback Mechanism Implementation
Implement graceful degradation to HTTP polling when WebSocket is unavailable.
- Create **src/client/transport/transportManager.js** to handle WebSocket/polling switching
- Implement feature detection for WebSocket support in client environment
- Add automatic fallback to HTTP polling when WebSocket connection fails repeatedly
- Create unified API interface that abstracts transport layer from application code
- Add configuration options to force polling mode for testing purposes

#### 2.3: Client Event Handlers
Replace existing polling logic with WebSocket event handlers throughout the application.
- Identify all current polling endpoints and their usage patterns in codebase audit
- Create **src/client/websocket/eventHandlers.js** mapping WebSocket events to application actions
- Replace polling intervals in UI components with WebSocket event subscriptions
- Update state management (Redux/Vuex/etc.) to handle real-time WebSocket updates
- Ensure proper cleanup of WebSocket subscriptions in component lifecycle methods

### Step 3: Server-Side Event Broadcasting
Implement server-side logic to broadcast events through WebSocket connections.

#### 3.1: Event Broadcasting System
Create the system to push server-side events to connected WebSocket clients.
- Create **src/websocket/broadcaster.js** to send messages to specific users or groups
- Implement room/channel concept for organizing connections by topic or user group
- Add integration points in existing business logic to trigger WebSocket broadcasts
- Replace server-side polling response generation with WebSocket message broadcasting
- Create message queuing system for offline users to receive messages on reconnection

#### 3.2: Database Integration
Update database operations to trigger WebSocket notifications for real-time updates.
- Add database triggers or application-level hooks to detect data changes
- Create **src/websocket/eventTriggers.js** to convert database changes to WebSocket events
- Implement selective broadcasting based on user permissions and subscriptions
- Add support for bulk operations to efficiently broadcast multiple changes
- Update existing API endpoints to broadcast changes via WebSocket after database updates

#### 3.3: Performance Optimization
Optimize WebSocket performance and resource usage for production deployment.
- Implement connection pooling and load balancing for multiple server instances
- Add message batching to reduce the number of individual WebSocket sends
- Create connection cleanup routines to remove stale connections
- Implement memory usage monitoring for connection manager
- Add WebSocket-specific logging and metrics collection

### Step 4: Testing and Migration
Comprehensive testing and gradual migration from polling to WebSocket implementation.

#### 4.1: Unit and Integration Testing
Create comprehensive test coverage for WebSocket functionality.
- Create **tests/websocket/server.test.js** with WebSocket server connection tests
- Add **tests/websocket/client.test.js** for client-side WebSocket functionality
- Create integration tests for authentication and message routing
- Add tests for fallback mechanism switching between WebSocket and polling
- Create load tests to verify WebSocket performance under high connection counts

#### 4.2: Feature Flag Implementation
Implement feature flags to control WebSocket rollout and enable A/B testing.
- Add **src/config/featureFlags.js** with WebSocket enable/disable flags
- Implement gradual rollout logic to enable WebSocket for percentage of users
- Add admin interface to control feature flag settings in real-time
- Create monitoring dashboard to compare WebSocket vs polling performance
- Add user preference setting to opt-in/opt-out of WebSocket connections

#### 4.3: Production Deployment Preparation
Prepare the WebSocket implementation for production deployment.
- Update **docker/Dockerfile** and **docker-compose.yml** to expose WebSocket ports
- Add WebSocket health check endpoints for load balancer configuration
- Update deployment scripts to handle WebSocket server startup and shutdown
- Create database migration scripts if needed for WebSocket-related tables
- Update monitoring and alerting configurations for WebSocket-specific metrics

### Step 5: Legacy Cleanup
Remove polling infrastructure after successful WebSocket migration.

#### 5.1: Polling Code Removal
Systematically remove polling-related code after WebSocket migration is complete.
- Remove polling interval timers and HTTP polling request logic from client code
- Delete unused polling API endpoints from server-side controllers
- Remove polling-specific configuration options and environment variables
- Clean up polling-related utility functions and helper classes
- Update documentation to remove references to polling implementation

#### 5.2: Final Optimization
Perform final optimizations and cleanup after migration completion.
