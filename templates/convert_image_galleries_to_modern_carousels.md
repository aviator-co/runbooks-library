# Convert Image Galleries to Modern Carousels

Convert existing static image galleries to modern, responsive carousel components with touch/swipe support, keyboard navigation, and accessibility features.

## Summary of changes
- Current image galleries use basic grid layouts with lightbox overlays that lack modern UX patterns
- Replace legacy gallery implementations with a unified carousel component system
- Add touch/swipe gestures, keyboard navigation, and ARIA accessibility support
- Implement responsive design with mobile-first approach and lazy loading optimization
- Maintain backward compatibility during transition period with feature flags

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Analysis and Planning
Conduct comprehensive audit of existing gallery implementations and establish technical requirements.

#### 1.1: Audit Current Gallery Implementations
Document all existing image gallery patterns, dependencies, and usage across the codebase.
- Scan codebase for gallery-related components in **src/components**, **src/pages**, and **src/widgets** directories
- Create inventory of current gallery types: grid galleries, lightbox galleries, thumbnail galleries
- Document existing CSS classes, JavaScript libraries, and third-party dependencies used
- Identify all pages and components that implement image galleries
- Create **docs/gallery-audit.md** with findings, screenshots, and technical debt assessment

#### 1.2: Define Modern Carousel Requirements
Establish technical specifications and design requirements for the new carousel system.
- Research modern carousel libraries and patterns (Swiper.js, Glide.js, custom solutions)
- Define functional requirements: touch/swipe, keyboard navigation, autoplay, thumbnails, fullscreen
- Specify accessibility requirements: ARIA labels, screen reader support, focus management
- Document responsive breakpoints and mobile-first design approach
- Create **docs/carousel-requirements.md** with detailed specifications and acceptance criteria

#### 1.3: Create Migration Strategy
Develop phased approach for converting galleries without breaking existing functionality.
