Comprehensive migration plan to replace existing SOAP web services with modern REST APIs while maintaining backward compatibility and ensuring zero downtime.

## Summary of changes
- Analyze existing SOAP services to understand current functionality, data models, and client dependencies
- Design REST API endpoints that provide equivalent functionality with improved performance and maintainability
- Implement REST services alongside existing SOAP services to enable gradual migration
- Update client applications to consume REST APIs while maintaining SOAP fallback during transition
- Establish monitoring and testing frameworks to ensure service reliability throughout migration
- Deprecate and remove SOAP services after successful REST adoption

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Analysis and Planning
Comprehensive assessment of current SOAP implementation and migration strategy development.

#### 1.1: SOAP Service Inventory and Analysis
Create comprehensive documentation of existing SOAP services including their contracts, dependencies, and usage patterns.
- Catalog all existing SOAP services with their **WSDL files**, endpoints, and operations
- Document data models, request/response schemas, and business logic for each service
- Identify client applications and their usage patterns through log analysis
- Map service dependencies and integration points with external systems
- Create **soap-analysis.md** document with findings and service categorization

#### 1.2: REST API Design and Architecture Planning
Design REST API structure that maintains functional equivalence while improving usability and performance.
- Define REST API resource models and endpoint structure based on SOAP operations
- Create **OpenAPI 3.0 specifications** for each planned REST service
- Design authentication and authorization strategy for REST endpoints
- Plan data transformation logic between SOAP XML and REST JSON formats
- Document migration timeline and rollback procedures in **migration-strategy.md**

#### 1.3: Client Impact Assessment
Analyze and document the impact on existing client applications and create migration guides.
- Identify all client applications consuming SOAP services through code analysis
- Document required changes for each client application to adopt REST APIs
- Create client migration guides with code examples in **client-migration-guide.md**
- Establish communication plan for notifying stakeholders about the migration timeline

### Step 2: Infrastructure and Foundation Setup
Establish the technical foundation required for REST services implementation.

#### 2.1: REST Framework Integration
Set up the REST framework and supporting infrastructure in the existing codebase.

- Update existing database scripts to support any new indexing requirements

#### 2.3: Configuration and Environment Setup
Configure application properties and deployment settings to support dual service architecture.
- Update application configuration files to include REST endpoint settings
- Configure separate context paths for SOAP (**/soap/**) and REST (**/api/v1/**) services
- Set up environment-specific configuration for development, staging, and production
- Configure logging frameworks to distinguish between SOAP and REST service calls
- Update deployment scripts and Docker configurations to support new service endpoints

### Step 3: Core REST Service Implementation
Implement REST services with equivalent functionality to existing SOAP services.

#### 3.1: Authentication and Security Services
Implement REST equivalents for authentication and authorization SOAP services.
- Create REST controllers for user authentication with JWT token generation
- Implement OAuth2 or API key-based authentication for REST endpoints
- Add role-based authorization middleware for REST service protection
- Create user management REST endpoints (create, update, delete, retrieve users)
- Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests for security services

#### 3.2: Business Logic Services Migration
Convert core business functionality from SOAP to REST while maintaining data consistency.
- Implement REST controllers for primary business operations identified in analysis
- Create service layer classes that handle business logic independent of transport protocol
- Add data validation and transformation logic for REST JSON payloads
- Implement proper HTTP status code handling and error response formatting
- Create comprehensive test suites covering all business scenarios and edge cases

#### 3.3: Integration and External Service Adapters
Develop REST endpoints that interact with external systems and databases.
- Create REST controllers for external system integration operations
- Implement async processing capabilities for long-running operations with proper status endpoints
- Add retry logic and circuit breaker patterns for external service calls
- Create webhook endpoints for receiving external system notifications
- Implement monitoring and health check endpoints for service status verification

### Step 4: Dual Service Operation and Testing
Enable parallel operation of SOAP and REST services with comprehensive testing coverage.

#### 4.1: Service Coexistence Configuration
Configure the application to run both SOAP and REST services simultaneously without conflicts.
- Update web server configuration to handle both SOAP and REST request routing
- Implement shared session management between SOAP and REST services
- Configure separate thread pools and resource allocation for each service type
- Add service discovery and registration for both SOAP and REST endpoints
- Create monitoring dashboards to track usage and performance of both service types

#### 4.2: Data Consistency and Synchronization
Ensure data consistency when both SOAP and REST services operate on shared resources.
- Implement distributed locking mechanisms for critical data operations
- Add transaction coordination between SOAP and REST service calls
- Create data validation rules that work consistently across both service types
- Implement audit logging that captures operations from both SOAP and REST services
- Add data integrity checks and automated reconciliation processes

#### 4.3: Comprehensive Testing Implementation
Create thorough testing coverage for both service types and their interactions.
- Implement automated integration tests that verify SOAP-to-REST functional equivalence
- Create performance tests comparing SOAP and REST service response times
- Add load testing scenarios that simulate mixed SOAP and REST traffic
- Implement contract testing to ensure API compatibility during migration
- Create end-to-end test suites that validate complete user workflows through both service types

### Step 5: Client Migration and Adoption
Support client applications in migrating from SOAP to REST services.
