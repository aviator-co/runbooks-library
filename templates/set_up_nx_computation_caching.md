# Set up Nx computation caching
Enable Nx computation caching to improve build performance by caching task results and avoiding redundant computations across the monorepo.

## Summary of changes
- Analyze current build and test performance to establish baseline metrics
- Configure Nx caching for build, test, lint, and other computational tasks
- Set up proper cache inputs and outputs for all project types
- Implement remote caching infrastructure for team collaboration
- Validate caching effectiveness and tune configuration for optimal performance

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Analysis and Planning
Initial assessment of current build system and caching requirements.

#### 1.1: Performance Baseline Analysis
Create a comprehensive analysis of current build and test performance to measure caching impact.
- Run `nx run-many --target=build --all --verbose` and capture timing metrics for all projects
- Run `nx run-many --target=test --all --verbose` and capture test execution times
- Document current CI/CD pipeline execution times and resource usage
- Create **docs/nx-caching-baseline.md** with performance metrics and identified bottlenecks

#### 1.2: Cache Strategy Documentation
Define caching strategy and requirements based on project structure and team workflow.
- Audit all existing Nx targets (build, test, lint, e2e) across all projects in the workspace
- Identify which tasks are cacheable and their input/output dependencies
- Document team development workflow and CI/CD requirements for remote caching
- Create **docs/nx-caching-strategy.md** with caching plan and target configuration requirements

### Step 2: Local Caching Configuration
Configure basic local caching for all computational tasks.

#### 2.1: Enable Nx Caching in Workspace Configuration
Update the main Nx configuration to enable caching with appropriate default settings.
- Modify **nx.json** to add `"cacheDirectory": ".nx/cache"` configuration
- Add default cache settings with `"defaultBase": "main"` for proper cache key generation
- Configure `"parallel": 3` and `"maxParallel": 5` for optimal task execution
- Update **.gitignore** to exclude `.nx/cache` directory from version control

#### 2.2: Configure Build Task Caching
Set up caching configuration for build tasks across all project types.
- Update **nx.json** `targetDefaults` to add caching for `build` target with inputs `["default", "^default"]`
- Configure outputs for build tasks as `["{projectRoot}/dist", "{projectRoot}/build"]`
- Add `"dependsOn": ["^build"]` to ensure proper dependency order for cached builds
- Test local caching by running builds twice and verifying cache hits with `nx build <project> --verbose`

#### 2.3: Configure Test Task Caching
Enable caching for test execution with proper input and output configuration.
- Add test target caching in **nx.json** `targetDefaults` with inputs `["default", "{projectRoot}/**/*.spec.ts", "{projectRoot}/**/*.test.ts"]`
- Configure test outputs as `["{projectRoot}/coverage", "{projectRoot}/test-results"]`
- Add environment-specific inputs like `{"env": "NODE_ENV"}` for tests that depend on environment variables
- Verify test caching works by running tests twice and confirming cache hits

#### 2.4: Configure Lint and Additional Task Caching
Set up caching for linting and other development tasks.
- Configure lint target caching with inputs `["default", "{projectRoot}/.eslintrc.json", "{workspaceRoot}/.eslintrc.json"]`
- Add caching for e2e tests with appropriate inputs and outputs configuration
- Configure any custom targets (storybook, type-check, etc.) with proper cache settings
- Test all cached targets by running `nx run-many --target=lint --all` twice to verify cache effectiveness

### Step 3: Remote Caching Setup
Implement shared caching infrastructure for team collaboration.

#### 3.1: Choose and Configure Remote Cache Provider
Set up remote caching infrastructure for team-wide cache sharing.
- Evaluate and select remote cache provider (Nx Cloud, AWS S3, or custom solution)
- Create **nx-cloud.json** or equivalent configuration file for remote cache settings
- Configure authentication and access credentials using environment variables
- Add remote cache configuration to **nx.json** with `"nxCloudAccessToken"` or custom remote cache URL

#### 3.2: CI/CD Pipeline Integration
Integrate remote caching into continuous integration workflows.
- Update CI configuration files (**.github/workflows**, **.gitlab-ci.yml**, etc.) to use Nx caching
- Add environment variables for remote cache authentication in CI/CD settings
- Configure CI to run `nx affected --target=build --parallel --max-parallel=3` for optimal cache utilization
- Add cache warming steps in CI to populate remote cache for common build scenarios

#### 3.3: Team Development Workflow Updates
Update development documentation and scripts to leverage caching effectively.
- Create **docs/development-workflow.md** with caching best practices and troubleshooting guide
- Update **package.json** scripts to use `nx affected` commands instead of `nx run-many` where appropriate
- Add cache management scripts for clearing local cache and debugging cache issues
- Document cache invalidation scenarios and manual cache clearing procedures

### Step 4: Optimization and Validation
Fine-tune caching configuration and validate performance improvements.

#### 4.1: Cache Performance Validation
Measure and validate caching performance improvements against baseline metrics.
- Run comprehensive build and test suites with caching enabled and measure performance improvements
- Compare cache hit rates and build times against baseline metrics from Step 1.1
- Document cache effectiveness in **docs/nx-caching-results.md** with before/after performance data
- Identify any tasks with poor cache hit rates and optimize their input/output configuration

#### 4.2: Cache Configuration Optimization
Fine-tune cache settings based on performance validation results.
- Optimize cache inputs for projects with low cache hit rates by reviewing file dependencies
- Adjust cache outputs to ensure all necessary artifacts are properly cached
- Configure cache size limits and cleanup policies in **nx.json** to manage disk usage
- Update parallel execution settings based on team hardware and CI/CD capacity

## Manual testing plan
- Clone repository fresh and run `nx build <project>` twice, verifying second run shows cache hit
- Modify a source file and run build again, confirming only affected projects rebuild
- Run `nx affected --target=test` after making changes, verifying only affected tests execute
- Test remote cache by having team member run builds and verify cache sharing across machines
- Validate CI/CD pipeline uses caching by checking build logs for cache hit/miss information
- Test cache invalidation by modifying shared dependencies and confirming proper cache clearing
