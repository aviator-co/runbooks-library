# Migrate FTP to SFTP File Transfer
Replace insecure FTP connections with secure SFTP protocol while maintaining backward compatibility and ensuring zero downtime migration.

## Summary of changes
- Current system uses plain FTP protocol for file transfers which transmits data and credentials in plaintext
- Migration involves updating connection libraries, configuration management, and authentication mechanisms
- Implementation includes feature flag support for gradual rollout and fallback capabilities
- All existing file transfer functionality will be preserved with enhanced security

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Analysis and Planning
Initial assessment and documentation of current FTP usage patterns and requirements.

#### 1.1: Audit Current FTP Usage
Document all existing FTP connections, configurations, and dependencies in the codebase.
- Scan codebase for FTP-related imports, classes, and configuration references
- Create **audit-ftp-usage.md** documenting all FTP endpoints, credentials storage, and usage patterns
- Identify all configuration files containing FTP settings
- Map out data flow diagrams showing file transfer processes
- Document current error handling and retry mechanisms

#### 1.2: Define SFTP Migration Requirements
Establish technical requirements and compatibility matrix for SFTP implementation.
- Create **sftp-migration-requirements.md** with security requirements and protocol specifications
- Define authentication methods (password, key-based, or both)
- Specify connection pooling and timeout requirements
- Document backward compatibility requirements and migration timeline
- Define rollback procedures and success criteria

#### 1.3: Design SFTP Architecture
Create detailed technical design for SFTP implementation with abstraction layer.
- Design connection abstraction interface supporting both FTP and SFTP
- Create **sftp-architecture-design.md** with class diagrams and interaction flows
- Define configuration schema supporting dual protocol setup
- Design feature flag mechanism for gradual migration
- Plan connection factory pattern for protocol selection

### Step 2: Infrastructure Preparation
Set up SFTP server infrastructure and update configuration management.

#### 2.1: Add SFTP Configuration Schema
Extend configuration system to support SFTP parameters alongside existing FTP settings.
- Add SFTP configuration classes with host, port, username, and authentication settings
- Update configuration validation to handle both FTP and SFTP parameters
- Modify configuration loading logic to support protocol-specific settings
- Add unit tests for new configuration classes
- Update configuration documentation and examples

#### 2.2: Implement Feature Flag System
Create feature flag mechanism to control FTP/SFTP protocol selection per endpoint.
- Add **ProtocolFeatureFlag** class with per-endpoint toggle capability
- Implement configuration-driven feature flag loading from properties/environment
- Create feature flag evaluation logic with fallback to FTP as default
- Add logging for feature flag decisions and protocol selection
- Write unit tests covering all feature flag scenarios

#### 2.3: Add SFTP Dependencies
Include required SFTP client libraries and update dependency management.
- Add JSch or Apache Commons VFS2 SFTP dependencies to **pom.xml**/**build.gradle**
- Update dependency version management and security scanning configurations
- Verify no conflicts with existing FTP libraries
- Update **DEPENDENCIES.md** with new library documentation
- Run dependency vulnerability scans and address any issues

### Step 3: Core SFTP Implementation
Implement SFTP client functionality with connection management and error handling.

#### 3.1: Create Connection Abstraction Layer
Implement protocol-agnostic interface for file transfer operations.
- Create **FileTransferClient** interface with upload, download, list, and delete methods
- Implement **FtpFileTransferClient** wrapper around existing FTP functionality
- Add connection lifecycle management methods (connect, disconnect, isConnected)
- Include error handling interfaces with protocol-specific exception mapping
- Write comprehensive unit tests for interface implementations

#### 3.2: Implement SFTP Client
Build SFTP client implementation following the established abstraction interface.
- Create **SftpFileTransferClient** class implementing **FileTransferClient** interface
- Implement connection establishment with SSH key and password authentication
- Add file transfer operations (upload, download, list files, delete)
- Implement connection pooling and session management
- Add comprehensive error handling with retry logic and connection recovery

#### 3.3: Create Protocol Factory
Implement factory pattern for selecting appropriate file transfer client based on configuration.
- Create **FileTransferClientFactory** with protocol selection logic
- Integrate feature flag evaluation for protocol determination
- Add connection caching and reuse mechanisms
- Implement graceful fallback from SFTP to FTP on connection failures
- Include extensive logging for protocol selection and connection events

### Step 4: Integration and Testing
Integrate SFTP functionality into existing file transfer workflows and add comprehensive testing.

#### 4.1: Update File Transfer Services
Modify existing file transfer services to use the new abstraction layer.
- Replace direct FTP client usage with **FileTransferClientFactory** calls
- Update service classes to handle both FTP and SFTP connections transparently
- Modify error handling to work with abstracted exception types
- Add protocol-specific logging and monitoring metrics
- Ensure all existing functionality remains unchanged

#### 4.2: Implement Integration Tests
Create comprehensive test suite covering both FTP and SFTP scenarios.
- Add integration tests using embedded SFTP server (Apache MINA SSHD)
- Create test scenarios for authentication methods (password and key-based)
- Implement connection failure and recovery test cases
- Add performance comparison tests between FTP and SFTP
- Create end-to-end tests covering complete file transfer workflows

#### 4.3: Add Monitoring and Metrics
Implement monitoring capabilities for tracking SFTP adoption and performance.
- Add metrics for protocol usage distribution (FTP vs SFTP connections)
- Implement connection success/failure rate tracking per protocol
- Add performance metrics comparing transfer speeds and connection times
- Create alerting for SFTP connection failures and fallback events
- Update monitoring dashboards to include SFTP-specific metrics

### Step 5: Deployment and Migration
Execute gradual migration with monitoring and rollback capabilities.

#### 5.1: Deploy with Feature Flags Disabled
Initial deployment with SFTP capability available but not active by default.
- Deploy code changes with all SFTP feature flags set to false
- Verify existing FTP functionality remains unaffected
- Monitor application performance and error rates post-deployment
- Validate configuration loading and feature flag evaluation
- Confirm rollback procedures are ready and tested

#### 5.2: Enable SFTP for Non-Critical Endpoints
Begin gradual migration starting with low-risk file transfer operations.
- Enable SFTP feature flags for development and staging environments
- Activate SFTP for non-critical batch processing endpoints
- Monitor connection success rates and transfer performance
- Validate error handling and fallback mechanisms in production-like conditions
- Document any issues and create remediation procedures

#### 5.3: Complete Migration to SFTP
Finalize migration by enabling SFTP for all endpoints and removing FTP fallback.
- Enable SFTP feature flags for all remaining production endpoints
- Monitor system stability and performance during full SFTP operation
- Remove FTP fallback logic after successful SFTP operation period
- Update configuration to remove FTP-specific settings
- Archive FTP client code and update documentation

## Manual testing plan
- Verify SFTP connections can be established using both password and SSH key authentication
- Test file upload and download operations with various file sizes and types
- Confirm directory listing and file deletion operations work correctly
- Validate error handling by simulating network failures and authentication errors
- Test feature flag toggling between FTP and SFTP protocols during runtime
- Verify monitoring dashboards display correct protocol usage metrics
- Confirm rollback procedures work by disabling SFTP flags and reverting to FTP
- Test connection pooling behavior under high concurrent load
- Validate configuration changes are picked up without application restart
- Verify encrypted data transmission using network packet analysis tools
