- Document current build matrix configurations, test suites, and deployment targets

#### 1.2: Design GitHub Actions Workflow Architecture
Create comprehensive migration plan with workflow designs and implementation timeline.
- Create **`github-actions-design.md`** with proposed workflow structure and file organization
- Design matrix build strategy for multiple environments, OS versions, and dependency combinations
- Plan secret migration strategy from Jenkins credentials to GitHub repository secrets
- Define workflow triggers, branch protection rules, and approval processes
- Create implementation timeline with rollback procedures in **`migration-timeline.md`**

### Step 2: Environment Setup
Prepare GitHub repository and initial workflow infrastructure for migration testing.

#### 2.1: Configure GitHub Repository Settings
Set up repository configuration and permissions required for GitHub Actions workflows.
- Enable GitHub Actions in repository settings if not already enabled
- Configure branch protection rules for main/master branch requiring status checks
- Set up repository secrets by migrating credentials from Jenkins credential store
- Configure environment protection rules for production deployments
- Set up GitHub Pages if documentation deployment is required

#### 2.2: Create Base Workflow Structure
Establish foundational GitHub Actions workflow files and directory structure.
- Create **`.github/workflows/`** directory in repository root
- Create **`ci.yml`** workflow file with basic structure for continuous integration
- Create **`cd.yml`** workflow file with deployment pipeline structure
- Add **`.github/actions/`** directory for custom composite actions
- Create **`setup-environment/action.yml`** composite action for common setup steps

### Step 3: Build Pipeline Migration
Convert Jenkins build processes to GitHub Actions workflows while maintaining functionality.

#### 3.1: Migrate Build and Test Workflows
Convert Jenkins build jobs to GitHub Actions with equivalent functionality and improved matrix builds.
- Implement build matrix in **`ci.yml`** covering all OS and language version combinations from Jenkins
- Convert Jenkins build scripts to GitHub Actions steps with proper caching strategies
- Migrate test execution including unit tests, integration tests, and code coverage reporting
- Add artifact upload/download actions to replace Jenkins artifact archiving
- Configure test result reporting using GitHub's native test reporting features

#### 3.2: Implement Code Quality Checks
Migrate Jenkins code quality and security scanning to GitHub Actions with enhanced reporting.
- Add static code analysis steps using GitHub's CodeQL or equivalent tools from Jenkins setup
- Implement dependency vulnerability scanning using GitHub's Dependabot or security actions
- Migrate linting and formatting checks with proper status reporting to pull requests
- Add code coverage reporting with GitHub Actions compatible tools
- Configure quality gates that match or improve upon Jenkins quality requirements

### Step 4: Deployment Pipeline Migration
Convert Jenkins deployment processes to GitHub Actions with environment-specific workflows.

#### 4.1: Migrate Staging Deployment
Convert Jenkins staging deployment pipeline to GitHub Actions with proper environment management.
- Create environment-specific workflow in **`cd.yml`** for staging deployments
- Migrate deployment scripts and configuration management from Jenkins to GitHub Actions
- Implement proper secret management for staging environment credentials
- Add deployment status reporting and rollback capabilities
- Configure staging environment protection rules and approval processes

#### 4.2: Migrate Production Deployment
Convert Jenkins production deployment pipeline with enhanced safety and approval workflows.
- Implement production deployment workflow with manual approval gates
- Migrate production deployment scripts with proper error handling and rollback procedures
- Configure production environment secrets and access controls
- Add deployment monitoring and notification systems
- Implement blue-green or canary deployment strategies if used in Jenkins

### Step 5: Monitoring and Notifications
Establish monitoring, alerting, and notification systems to replace Jenkins capabilities.

#### 5.1: Configure Workflow Monitoring
Set up comprehensive monitoring and alerting for GitHub Actions workflows.
- Configure workflow failure notifications to replace Jenkins email/Slack notifications
- Set up GitHub Actions usage monitoring and cost tracking
- Implement workflow performance monitoring and optimization alerts
- Create dashboard for workflow status and metrics visualization
- Configure integration with existing monitoring tools used with Jenkins

#### 5.2: Migrate Reporting and Analytics
Convert Jenkins reporting and analytics to GitHub Actions compatible solutions.
- Migrate build trend reporting to GitHub Actions insights and custom dashboards
- Set up test result trending and failure analysis reporting
- Implement deployment frequency and success rate tracking
- Create custom reporting scripts for metrics previously gathered by Jenkins
- Configure integration with existing business intelligence or reporting systems

### Step 6: Validation and Cutover
Validate GitHub Actions workflows and perform controlled migration from Jenkins.

#### 6.1: Parallel Testing Phase
Run GitHub Actions workflows alongside Jenkins to validate functionality and performance.
- Configure GitHub Actions workflows to run on all pull requests while Jenkins remains primary
- Compare build times, test results, and deployment outcomes between Jenkins and GitHub Actions
- Validate all integrations including external services, databases, and third-party tools
- Test failure scenarios and rollback procedures in non-production environments
- Document any discrepancies and implement fixes in GitHub Actions workflows

#### 6.2: Production Cutover
Execute controlled migration from Jenkins to GitHub Actions as primary CI/CD system.
- Update branch protection rules to require GitHub Actions status checks instead of Jenkins
- Disable Jenkins webhooks and polling for the migrated repository
- Update documentation and developer guides to reference GitHub Actions instead of Jenkins
- Archive Jenkins job configurations and create backup procedures
- Monitor initial production runs closely and implement immediate fixes if needed

### Step 7: Cleanup and Optimization
Remove Jenkins dependencies and optimize GitHub Actions workflows for long-term maintainability.

#### 7.1: Jenkins Cleanup
Remove Jenkins infrastructure and dependencies after successful migration validation.
- Archive Jenkins job configurations and build history for compliance requirements
- Remove Jenkins webhooks and integrations from repository settings
- Update infrastructure automation to exclude Jenkins servers if no longer needed
- Clean up Jenkins-specific scripts and configuration files from repository
