# Migrate Travis CI to GitLab CI
Migrate continuous integration pipeline from Travis CI to GitLab CI/CD with feature parity and improved deployment capabilities.

## Summary of changes
- Current project uses Travis CI for automated builds, tests, and deployments with `.travis.yml` configuration
- GitLab CI/CD offers better integration with GitLab repositories, improved caching, and more flexible pipeline configurations
- Migration will maintain all existing CI/CD functionality while leveraging GitLab's native features like built-in container registry and enhanced security scanning
- All deployment workflows, environment variables, and notification systems will be preserved during the transition

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Analysis and Planning
Initial assessment of current Travis CI configuration and GitLab CI/CD requirements preparation.

#### 1.1: Audit Current Travis CI Configuration
Document the existing Travis CI setup to ensure complete feature migration.
- Analyze `.travis.yml` file structure, build stages, and job configurations
- Document all environment variables, secrets, and encrypted values used in Travis CI
- List all deployment targets, notification webhooks, and integration points
- Identify any Travis CI-specific features or addons currently in use
- Create **`docs/ci-migration-audit.md`** with comprehensive analysis of current setup

#### 1.2: Research GitLab CI/CD Equivalents
Map Travis CI features to corresponding GitLab CI/CD capabilities.
- Research GitLab CI/CD syntax and feature equivalents for each Travis CI component
- Identify GitLab-specific improvements that can enhance the current pipeline
- Document any features that require different implementation approaches
- Plan the GitLab Runner requirements and execution environment setup
- Update **`docs/ci-migration-audit.md`** with GitLab CI/CD mapping and recommendations

### Step 2: GitLab CI/CD Configuration Setup
Create the initial GitLab CI/CD pipeline configuration with basic functionality.

#### 2.1: Create Base GitLab CI Configuration
Establish the foundation `.gitlab-ci.yml` file with essential pipeline structure.
- Create **`.gitlab-ci.yml`** file in repository root with basic stages (build, test, deploy)
- Configure GitLab CI/CD variables equivalent to Travis CI environment variables
- Set up basic job definitions for build and test stages
- Configure appropriate Docker images or runner environments matching Travis CI setup
- Ensure the pipeline can be triggered and basic jobs execute successfully

#### 2.2: Implement Build Stage Migration
Migrate Travis CI build processes to GitLab CI/CD build jobs.
- Convert Travis CI build commands and scripts to GitLab CI/CD job format
- Migrate any build matrix configurations to parallel GitLab CI/CD jobs
- Configure build artifacts and caching strategies using GitLab CI/CD cache and artifacts
- Set up proper dependency management and package installation steps
- Verify build jobs execute successfully and produce expected artifacts

#### 2.3: Implement Test Stage Migration
Migrate all testing workflows from Travis CI to GitLab CI/CD test jobs.
- Convert test execution commands and test suite configurations
- Migrate code coverage reporting and test result publishing
- Configure parallel test execution if used in Travis CI
- Set up test artifact collection and reporting
- Ensure all test jobs pass and maintain same coverage standards as Travis CI

### Step 3: Advanced Features and Deployment Migration
Migrate complex Travis CI features including deployments, notifications, and integrations.

#### 3.1: Migrate Deployment Workflows
Convert Travis CI deployment configurations to GitLab CI/CD deployment jobs.
- Migrate deployment scripts and deployment target configurations
- Convert Travis CI deployment conditions to GitLab CI/CD rules and only/except conditions
- Configure GitLab CI/CD environments for different deployment targets (staging, production)
- Set up deployment secrets and credentials using GitLab CI/CD variables
- Test deployment jobs in non-production environments first

#### 3.2: Configure Notifications and Integrations
Migrate Travis CI notifications and external integrations to GitLab CI/CD equivalents.
- Convert Slack, email, or webhook notifications to GitLab CI/CD notification settings
- Migrate any external service integrations (code quality tools, monitoring systems)
- Configure GitLab CI/CD pipeline triggers and webhook configurations
- Set up status badge URLs and repository integration points
- Test all notification channels and integration endpoints

#### 3.3: Implement Advanced GitLab CI/CD Features
Enhance the pipeline with GitLab-native features that improve upon Travis CI capabilities.
- Configure GitLab Container Registry integration if applicable
- Set up GitLab security scanning (SAST, dependency scanning, container scanning)
- Implement GitLab merge request pipelines and branch protection rules
- Configure pipeline schedules for recurring jobs previously handled by Travis CI cron
- Add GitLab Pages deployment if static site generation is part of the workflow

### Step 4: Testing and Validation
Comprehensive testing of the new GitLab CI/CD pipeline before decommissioning Travis CI.

#### 4.1: Parallel Pipeline Testing
Run both Travis CI and GitLab CI/CD pipelines simultaneously to validate equivalence.
- Configure GitLab CI/CD pipeline to run on all branches and merge requests
- Compare build times, test results, and deployment outcomes between both systems
- Validate that all environment variables and secrets work correctly in GitLab CI/CD
- Ensure artifact generation and caching work as expected
- Document any discrepancies and resolve configuration issues

#### 4.2: Edge Case and Failure Scenario Testing
Test GitLab CI/CD pipeline behavior under various failure and edge case scenarios.
- Test pipeline behavior with failing tests, build errors, and deployment failures
- Validate retry mechanisms and failure notification systems
- Test pipeline behavior with different branch types, tags, and merge request scenarios
- Verify that all conditional logic and deployment rules work correctly
- Ensure pipeline cleanup and resource management work properly

### Step 5: Documentation and Transition
Complete the migration with proper documentation and Travis CI decommissioning.

#### 5.1: Update Project Documentation
Update all project documentation to reflect the new GitLab CI/CD setup.
- Update **`README.md`** with new build status badges and CI/CD information
- Create or update **`docs/ci-cd-setup.md`** with GitLab CI/CD configuration details
- Update contributing guidelines with new CI/CD workflow information
- Document any new GitLab-specific features or workflow changes for team members
- Remove Travis CI references from all documentation files

#### 5.2: Decommission Travis CI
Safely remove Travis CI configuration and disable the service.
- Disable Travis CI builds for the repository in Travis CI dashboard
- Remove **`.travis.yml`** file from the repository
- Clean up any Travis CI-specific scripts or configuration files
- Remove Travis CI webhook configurations and integrations
- Archive Travis CI build history and logs if needed for compliance
- Update any external systems that reference Travis CI build status or artifacts

## Manual testing plan
- Trigger GitLab CI/CD pipeline on feature branch and verify all stages complete successfully
- Create merge request and confirm that merge request pipelines execute correctly
- Test deployment to staging environment through GitLab CI/CD pipeline
- Verify that all notifications (Slack, email) are received when pipeline fails or succeeds
- Confirm that build artifacts are properly stored and accessible through GitLab interface
- Test pipeline behavior with different commit types (regular commits, tags, merge commits)
- Validate that environment variables and secrets are properly masked in pipeline logs
- Test pipeline cancellation and retry functionality through GitLab interface
- Verify that GitLab security scanning features are working and reporting results correctly
- Confirm that pipeline schedules trigger correctly and execute expected jobs
