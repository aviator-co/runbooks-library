# Vue 2 to Vue 3 Migration Runbook
Comprehensive migration plan to upgrade a Vue 2 application to Vue 3 with minimal disruption and maximum compatibility.

## Summary of changes
- Vue 2 uses Options API and different reactivity system compared to Vue 3's Composition API and Proxy-based reactivity
- Breaking changes include removed/renamed APIs, different build tools, updated router and state management libraries
- Migration involves updating core dependencies, refactoring components, updating build configuration, and ensuring test compatibility
- Plan includes compatibility layer usage to minimize immediate breaking changes and gradual migration approach

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Pre-Migration Analysis and Planning
Comprehensive assessment of current codebase and creation of migration strategy documentation.

#### 1.1: Codebase Audit and Compatibility Assessment
Create detailed analysis of current Vue 2 usage patterns and potential migration blockers.
- Run `vue-compat` migration helper to identify breaking changes and deprecated features
- Document all Vue 2 specific APIs, plugins, and third-party libraries currently in use
- Create inventory of custom directives, filters, and mixins that need migration
- Identify components using deprecated lifecycle hooks or event handling patterns
- List all Vuex store modules and their usage patterns for potential Pinia migration

#### 1.2: Dependency Analysis and Upgrade Planning
Analyze all Vue ecosystem dependencies and create upgrade roadmap.
- Audit **package.json** for Vue ecosystem packages (vue-router, vuex, vue-loader, etc.)
- Research Vue 3 compatible versions of all third-party Vue plugins and libraries
- Identify packages that don't have Vue 3 support and find alternatives
- Document breaking changes in vue-router 3 to 4 and vuex 3 to 4 migrations
- Create compatibility matrix document in **docs/vue3-migration-plan.md**

#### 1.3: Migration Strategy Documentation
Document the complete migration approach and timeline.
- Create **docs/vue3-migration-strategy.md** with step-by-step migration plan
- Define rollback procedures and risk mitigation strategies
- Document testing strategy for each migration phase
- Create checklist template for component migration validation
- Set up feature flags or environment variables for gradual rollout planning

### Step 2: Development Environment Setup
Prepare development environment and tooling for Vue 3 compatibility.

#### 2.1: Build Tool Configuration Updates
Update build configuration to support both Vue 2 and Vue 3 during transition.
- Update **webpack.config.js** or **vite.config.js** to support Vue 3 compilation
- Configure **babel.config.js** with Vue 3 compatible presets and plugins
- Update **eslint** configuration with Vue 3 rules in **.eslintrc.js**
- Modify **jest.config.js** or **vitest.config.js** for Vue 3 test environment
- Update **tsconfig.json** if using TypeScript with Vue 3 type definitions

#### 2.2: Package Manager and Dependency Updates
Install Vue 3 compatibility layer and update core dependencies.
- Install `@vue/compat` package for Vue 2/3 compatibility mode
- Update **package.json** with Vue 3 compatible versions of core packages
- Install Vue 3 development tools and updated CLI if applicable
- Update **package-lock.json** or **yarn.lock** with new dependency versions
- Verify all development scripts in **package.json** work with new setup

### Step 3: Core Vue Migration
Migrate core Vue application setup and configuration.

#### 3.1: Application Bootstrap Migration
Update main application entry point from Vue 2 to Vue 3 API.
- Modify **src/main.js** to use `createApp()` instead of `new Vue()`
- Update global plugin registration syntax for Vue 3 compatibility
- Migrate global properties and configuration options to new API
- Update root component mounting and unmounting logic
- Ensure compatibility mode is properly configured during transition

#### 3.2: Router Migration to Vue Router 4
Upgrade routing configuration and navigation guards for Vue Router 4.
- Update **src/router/index.js** with Vue Router 4 syntax and `createRouter()`
- Migrate navigation guards to new API (`beforeRouteEnter`, `beforeRouteUpdate`)
- Update route component lazy loading syntax if using dynamic imports
- Modify router-link and router-view usage for any breaking changes
- Update programmatic navigation calls to use new router instance methods

#### 3.3: State Management Migration
Migrate from Vuex to Pinia or update to Vuex 4 for Vue 3 compatibility.
- Create **src/stores/index.js** with Pinia setup if migrating from Vuex
- Migrate existing Vuex modules to Pinia stores or update to Vuex 4 syntax
- Update component state management imports and usage patterns
- Modify state subscription and watching patterns for new API
- Update any middleware or plugins that interact with state management

### Step 4: Component Migration
Systematically migrate Vue components from Options API to Composition API or Vue 3 compatible Options API.

#### 4.1: Component API Migration Strategy
Establish consistent patterns for component migration across the application.
- Create component migration template and guidelines in **docs/component-migration-guide.md**
- Define standards for Composition API usage vs Options API retention
- Establish patterns for reactive data, computed properties, and method conversions
- Create reusable composables for common functionality patterns
- Set up component testing templates for Vue 3 compatibility

#### 4.2: Core Component Migration
Migrate essential application components to Vue 3 compatible syntax.
- Update **src/components/App.vue** with Vue 3 compatible template syntax
- Migrate layout components and remove deprecated `$listeners` and `$attrs` usage
- Update form components to use new `v-model` syntax and event handling
- Migrate list rendering components to handle new `key` requirements
- Update any components using deprecated lifecycle hooks (`beforeDestroy` to `beforeUnmount`)

#### 4.3: Feature Component Migration
Migrate feature-specific components and handle complex state patterns.
- Update components using mixins to Composition API or composables
- Migrate components with custom directives to Vue 3 directive API
- Update components using filters to computed properties or methods
- Migrate async components to new `defineAsyncComponent` API
- Update teleport usage if components were using portal-vue or similar

### Step 5: Template and Directive Updates
Update Vue templates and custom directives for Vue 3 compatibility.

#### 5.1: Template Syntax Migration
Update template syntax to comply with Vue 3 requirements and best practices.
- Remove or update deprecated template features (filters, `$listeners`)
- Update `v-model` usage on custom components to new syntax
- Migrate `v-for` templates to include required `key` attributes properly
- Update slot syntax to use new `v-slot` directive consistently
- Fix template fragments and multiple root node components

#### 5.2: Custom Directive Migration
Update custom directives to Vue 3 directive API.
- Migrate custom directives in **src/directives/** to new lifecycle hooks
- Update directive hook names (`bind` to `beforeMount`, `update` to `updated`)
- Modify directive argument and modifier handling for new API
- Update global directive registration in main application file
- Test directive functionality with Vue 3 reactivity system

### Step 6: Testing Migration
Update test suites and testing utilities for Vue 3 compatibility.

#### 6.1: Unit Test Migration
Update component unit tests to work with Vue 3 and Vue Test Utils v2.
- Update **test/unit/** test files to use `@vue/test-utils` v2 API
- Migrate component mounting syntax (`mount`, `shallowMount`) to new API
- Update test assertions for Vue 3 component structure and behavior

### Step 7: Performance and Optimization
Optimize the migrated Vue 3 application and remove compatibility layers.

#### 7.1: Compatibility Mode Removal
Gradually remove Vue 2 compatibility mode and optimize for Vue 3.
- Remove `@vue/compat` dependency and compatibility mode configuration
- Update any remaining Vue 2 patterns to native Vue 3 implementations
- Optimize bundle size by removing compatibility layer overhead
- Update build configuration to target Vue 3 exclusively
- Verify all functionality works without compatibility mode

#### 7.2: Performance Optimization
Implement Vue 3 specific optimizations and modern patterns.
