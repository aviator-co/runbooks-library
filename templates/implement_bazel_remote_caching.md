# Implement Bazel remote caching
Enable remote caching for Bazel builds to improve build performance and reduce CI/CD times across the development team.

## Summary of changes
- Current Bazel setup lacks remote caching, causing redundant builds and slow CI/CD pipelines
- Add remote cache configuration to `.bazelrc` and workspace files
- Set up authentication and security for remote cache access
- Configure cache eviction policies and storage backends
- Update CI/CD pipelines to utilize remote caching
- Add monitoring and metrics collection for cache performance

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Infrastructure Setup
Establish the foundational components needed for remote caching infrastructure.

#### 1.1: Remote Cache Backend Selection and Setup
Evaluate and configure the remote cache storage backend (Google Cloud Storage, AWS S3, or self-hosted).
- Research available remote cache backends and document findings in **docs/bazel-remote-cache-analysis.md**
- Create infrastructure configuration files for the chosen backend (Terraform/CloudFormation)
- Set up storage buckets/containers with appropriate permissions and lifecycle policies
- Configure network access and firewall rules for cache access
- Test basic connectivity to the remote cache backend

#### 1.2: Authentication Configuration
Set up secure authentication mechanisms for remote cache access.
- Create service accounts or IAM roles for Bazel remote cache access
- Generate and securely store authentication credentials
- Configure credential rotation policies and procedures
- Document authentication setup in **docs/bazel-remote-cache-auth.md**
- Test authentication from development and CI environments

### Step 2: Bazel Configuration
Configure Bazel to use the remote cache with appropriate settings and optimizations.

#### 2.1: Basic Remote Cache Configuration
Add fundamental remote caching configuration to Bazel workspace.
- Add remote cache flags to **.bazelrc** file with cache endpoint URLs
- Configure cache read/write permissions and timeout settings
- Add platform-specific cache configurations for different OS/architecture combinations
- Set up cache key generation and invalidation rules
- Test basic remote cache functionality with simple build targets

#### 2.2: Advanced Cache Settings
Implement advanced caching strategies and optimizations.
- Configure cache compression and encryption settings in **.bazelrc**
- Add cache partitioning based on build configurations and platforms
- Implement cache warming strategies for frequently used dependencies
- Configure cache size limits and eviction policies
- Add cache debugging and verbose logging options for troubleshooting

#### 2.3: Workspace Integration
Update workspace files to support remote caching across all build targets.
- Modify **WORKSPACE** file to include remote cache repository rules
- Update **BUILD.bazel** files to add appropriate tags for cache optimization
- Configure remote cache for external dependencies and third-party libraries
- Add cache-friendly configuration for code generation and dynamic builds
- Ensure all build rules are compatible with remote caching

### Step 3: CI/CD Integration
Integrate remote caching into continuous integration and deployment pipelines.

#### 3.1: CI Pipeline Configuration
Update CI/CD configuration files to enable remote caching.
- Modify CI configuration files (**.github/workflows**, **.gitlab-ci.yml**, etc.) to use remote cache flags
- Add authentication setup steps for CI environments
- Configure cache warming jobs for common build targets
- Add cache statistics collection and reporting
- Update build scripts and makefiles to use remote cache options

#### 3.2: Build Performance Optimization
Optimize CI/CD builds to maximize cache hit rates and performance gains.
- Implement build target ordering to maximize cache reuse
- Configure parallel builds with remote cache coordination
- Add cache preloading for critical build paths
- Optimize build configurations to improve cache key stability
- Add build time monitoring and cache hit rate tracking

### Step 4: Monitoring and Maintenance
Implement monitoring, alerting, and maintenance procedures for the remote cache system.

#### 4.1: Metrics and Monitoring Setup
Implement comprehensive monitoring for remote cache performance and health.
- Add cache hit rate metrics collection to build scripts
- Configure monitoring dashboards for cache performance (Grafana/DataDog)
- Set up alerting for cache availability and performance issues
- Implement cache storage usage monitoring and capacity planning
- Add build time comparison metrics (before/after remote cache)

#### 4.2: Maintenance Procedures
Establish procedures for ongoing remote cache maintenance and optimization.
- Create cache cleanup and maintenance scripts in **scripts/cache-maintenance/**
- Document cache troubleshooting procedures in **docs/bazel-remote-cache-troubleshooting.md**
- Implement cache health checks and automated recovery procedures
- Set up regular cache performance reviews and optimization cycles
- Create runbooks for common cache-related issues and resolutions

### Step 5: Documentation and Training
Create comprehensive documentation and training materials for the remote cache system.

#### 5.1: Developer Documentation
Create detailed documentation for developers using the remote cache system.
- Write comprehensive setup guide in **docs/bazel-remote-cache-setup.md**
- Document local development configuration and best practices
- Create troubleshooting guide for common developer issues
- Add remote cache usage examples and optimization tips
- Document cache debugging techniques and tools

#### 5.2: Team Training and Rollout
Plan and execute team training for the new remote cache system.
- Create training presentation materials on remote cache benefits and usage
- Conduct team training sessions on remote cache configuration and troubleshooting
- Set up pilot program with select team members for initial testing
- Gather feedback and iterate on configuration and documentation
- Plan full team rollout with support procedures

## Manual testing plan
- Verify remote cache connectivity from local development environment using `bazel build //... --remote_cache=<cache-url>`
- Test cache hit rates by building the same target multiple times and confirming subsequent builds are faster
- Validate authentication by attempting builds with invalid credentials and confirming appropriate error messages
- Test cache behavior across different platforms by building on multiple OS/architecture combinations
- Verify CI/CD integration by triggering builds and confirming cache usage in build logs
- Test cache eviction by filling cache to capacity and confirming oldest entries are removed
- Validate monitoring dashboards show accurate cache hit rates and performance metrics
- Test cache recovery procedures by simulating cache backend failures and confirming graceful degradation
