# Migrate Express.js 4 to Express.js 5
Upgrade the Express.js framework from version 4 to version 5 with breaking changes handling and compatibility updates.

## Summary of changes
- Express.js 5 introduces breaking changes including middleware signature changes, removed deprecated methods, and updated error handling
- Router behavior changes require updates to route definitions and middleware patterns
- Body parser and other built-in middleware have been externalized and need explicit installation
- Promise support improvements require updates to async route handlers and error handling
- Security enhancements and performance optimizations need configuration updates

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Pre-migration Analysis and Documentation
Comprehensive analysis of current Express.js 4 usage patterns and potential breaking changes.

#### 1.1: Audit Current Express.js Usage
Create a comprehensive audit of the current Express.js 4 implementation to identify potential breaking changes.
- Scan all JavaScript/TypeScript files for Express.js imports and usage patterns
- Document all middleware usage, route definitions, and Express-specific configurations
- Identify deprecated methods and patterns that will break in Express.js 5
- Create **migration-audit.md** in the project root with findings and recommendations
- List all Express.js plugins and middleware dependencies that may need updates

#### 1.2: Analyze Dependencies and Compatibility
Review all Express.js related dependencies for Express.js 5 compatibility.
- Check **package.json** for all Express.js related dependencies and their versions
- Research compatibility of each middleware package with Express.js 5
- Document incompatible packages and their Express.js 5 alternatives in **migration-audit.md**
- Identify packages that need to be added (like body-parser, cookie-parser) due to externalization
- Create a dependency upgrade plan with version targets

#### 1.3: Create Migration Strategy Document
Develop a detailed migration strategy based on the audit findings.
- Create **express5-migration-strategy.md** documenting the step-by-step approach
- Define rollback procedures and testing checkpoints
- Document expected downtime and deployment considerations
- Include performance benchmarking plan for before/after comparison
- Define success criteria and validation steps

### Step 2: Environment and Testing Preparation
Set up testing infrastructure and create compatibility layers for safe migration.

- Implement feature flags for Express.js 5 specific features
- Add logging to track which Express.js version is being used
- Update **package.json** scripts to support version switching

#### 2.2: Enhance Test Coverage for Express Routes
Expand test coverage to ensure all Express.js functionality is properly tested before migration.
- Add integration tests for all API endpoints in **tests/integration/routes/**
- Create middleware testing suite in **tests/unit/middleware/**
- Add error handling tests for all route handlers
- Implement request/response validation tests
- Ensure all tests pass with current Express.js 4 setup

#### 2.3: Set Up Parallel Testing Environment
Create infrastructure to test both Express.js versions simultaneously.
- Update **docker-compose.yml** to support multiple Express.js versions
- Create separate test configurations for Express.js 4 and 5
- Add CI/CD pipeline steps to test against both versions
- Configure separate database instances for parallel testing
- Update **README.md** with new testing procedures

### Step 3: Core Dependencies Update
Update Express.js and handle externalized middleware dependencies.

#### 3.1: Install Express.js 5 and Required Middleware
Update Express.js to version 5 and add previously built-in middleware as separate dependencies.
- Update **package.json** to use Express.js 5.x (latest stable version)
- Add **body-parser**, **cookie-parser**, **express-session** as explicit dependencies
- Add **multer** if file upload functionality is used
- Remove any Express.js 4 specific polyfills or compatibility packages
- Run **npm install** and verify all dependencies resolve correctly

#### 3.2: Update Express.js Imports and Basic Setup
Modify the main Express.js application setup to work with version 5.
- Update **app.js** or **server.js** to import required middleware explicitly
- Replace **app.use(express.bodyParser())** with explicit body-parser configuration
- Update cookie parser initialization to use the external package
- Modify session configuration to use the external express-session package
- Ensure the Express.js application still starts without errors

#### 3.3: Fix Middleware Signature Changes
Update middleware functions to match Express.js 5 signature requirements.
- Update custom middleware in **src/middleware/** to handle new signature patterns
- Fix any middleware that relied on **req.param()** method (now removed)
- Update error handling middleware to use the new 4-parameter signature consistently
- Modify any middleware using deprecated **res.json()** behavior
- Test that all middleware functions work correctly with sample requests

### Step 4: Route and Error Handling Updates
Update route definitions and error handling to comply with Express.js 5 changes.

#### 4.1: Update Route Handler Patterns
Modify route handlers to work with Express.js 5 routing changes.
- Update all route files in **src/routes/** to handle new router behavior
- Fix any routes using deprecated **router.param()** callback patterns
- Update route handlers that depend on **req.param()** to use **req.params**, **req.query**, or **req.body**
- Modify any routes using deprecated **res.send()** behavior with status codes
- Ensure all route handlers properly handle async operations

#### 4.2: Implement Promise-based Error Handling
Update error handling to leverage Express.js 5's improved Promise support.
- Update **src/middleware/error-handler.js** to handle both callback and Promise-based errors
- Modify async route handlers to properly propagate errors using **next()**
- Implement global Promise rejection handling for unhandled async errors
- Update error logging and monitoring to capture new error patterns
- Test error handling with both synchronous and asynchronous error scenarios

#### 4.3: Update Response and Request Object Usage
Fix any code that relies on deprecated request/response object methods or properties.
