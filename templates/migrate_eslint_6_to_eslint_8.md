# Migrate ESLint 6 to ESLint 8
Upgrade ESLint from version 6 to version 8 with configuration updates and dependency management.

## Summary of changes
- Current codebase uses ESLint 6.x which is outdated and lacks modern JavaScript/TypeScript support
- ESLint 8 introduces flat config format, updated rules, and improved performance
- Migration requires updating configuration files, resolving deprecated rules, and updating related dependencies
- Gradual upgrade approach to maintain build stability throughout the process

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Analysis and Preparation
Assess current ESLint setup and prepare for migration by documenting existing configuration and identifying potential issues.

#### 1.1: Audit Current ESLint Configuration
Document the current ESLint setup to understand the scope of changes needed for migration.
- Create **docs/eslint-migration-audit.md** documenting current ESLint version, configuration files, and active rules
- List all ESLint-related dependencies in **package.json** including plugins and parsers
- Document any custom rules or configurations that may need special handling
- Identify files and directories currently covered by ESLint configuration

#### 1.2: Research ESLint 8 Breaking Changes
Analyze breaking changes between ESLint 6 and 8 to plan the migration strategy.
- Document breaking changes from ESLint 6→7 and 7→8 in **docs/eslint-migration-audit.md**
- Identify deprecated rules that need replacement or removal
- Research new flat config format requirements and benefits
- Document plugin compatibility with ESLint 8

#### 1.3: Create Migration Strategy Document
Develop a detailed strategy for handling the ESLint upgrade process.
- Create **docs/eslint-migration-strategy.md** outlining the step-by-step approach
- Define rollback plan in case of critical issues
- Document expected timeline and potential risks
- Identify code areas that may require manual fixes after upgrade

### Step 2: Dependency Updates
Update ESLint and related dependencies while maintaining backward compatibility where possible.

#### 2.1: Update ESLint to Version 7
Perform intermediate upgrade to ESLint 7 to reduce breaking changes impact.
- Update **package.json** to specify ESLint version `^7.32.0`
- Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to update dependencies
- Execute `npm run lint` to identify any immediate issues
- Fix any configuration warnings or errors that appear
- Commit changes with message "chore: upgrade ESLint to version 7"

#### 2.2: Update ESLint Plugins and Parsers
Ensure all ESLint plugins are compatible with ESLint 7 and prepare for ESLint 8.
- Update **@typescript-eslint/parser** and **@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin** to latest compatible versions
- Update **eslint-plugin-react**, **eslint-plugin-import**, and other plugins to ESLint 7 compatible versions
- Update **package.json** with new plugin versions
- Run tests to ensure no regressions are introduced
- Commit changes with message "chore: update ESLint plugins for v7 compatibility"

#### 2.3: Update ESLint to Version 8
Complete the major version upgrade to ESLint 8.
- Update **package.json** to specify ESLint version `^8.57.0`
- Update all ESLint plugins to their latest ESLint 8 compatible versions
- Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to update dependencies
- Execute `npm run lint` to identify configuration issues
- Commit changes with message "chore: upgrade ESLint to version 8"

### Step 3: Configuration Migration
Update ESLint configuration files to work with ESLint 8 requirements and optionally migrate to flat config.

#### 3.1: Fix Deprecated Rules and Configuration
Address deprecated rules and configuration options that are no longer supported in ESLint 8.
- Update **.eslintrc.js** or **.eslintrc.json** to remove deprecated rules identified in audit
- Replace deprecated rules with their ESLint 8 equivalents
- Update parser options and environment settings for ESLint 8 compatibility
- Test configuration by running `npx eslint --print-config src/index.js` to verify parsing
- Commit changes with message "fix: update ESLint configuration for v8 compatibility"

#### 3.2: Resolve Rule Conflicts and Warnings
Fix any rule conflicts or warnings that appear after the ESLint 8 upgrade.
- Run `npm run lint` and document all new warnings or errors
- Update rule configurations in **.eslintrc.js** to resolve conflicts
- Disable or modify rules that are causing false positives
- Ensure all existing code passes linting with updated rules
- Commit changes with message "fix: resolve ESLint 8 rule conflicts"

#### 3.3: Optimize ESLint Configuration
Clean up and optimize the ESLint configuration for better performance and maintainability.
- Remove unused rules and plugins from **.eslintrc.js**
- Consolidate duplicate configurations across different file patterns
- Add comments explaining complex rule configurations
- Verify configuration works across all file types (JS, TS, JSX, TSX)
- Commit changes with message "refactor: optimize ESLint configuration"

### Step 4: Flat Config Migration (Optional)
Migrate to ESLint's new flat config format for improved performance and maintainability.

#### 4.1: Create Flat Config File
Set up the new **eslint.config.js** file alongside existing configuration for gradual migration.
- Create **eslint.config.js** with equivalent rules from **.eslintrc.js**
- Convert extends and plugins to flat config format
- Test flat config by running `npx eslint --config eslint.config.js src/`
- Ensure both configurations produce identical linting results
- Commit changes with message "feat: add ESLint flat config alongside legacy config"

#### 4.2: Update Package Scripts for Flat Config
Update npm scripts and CI configuration to use the new flat config format.
- Update **package.json** lint scripts to use `--config eslint.config.js`
- Update CI configuration files to use flat config
- Update IDE configuration files (**.vscode/settings.json**) if present
- Test all lint-related scripts work correctly
- Commit changes with message "chore: update scripts to use ESLint flat config"

#### 4.3: Remove Legacy Configuration
Clean up old ESLint configuration files after confirming flat config works correctly.
- Remove **.eslintrc.js**, **.eslintrc.json**, or **.eslintrc.yml** files
- Update documentation to reference new flat config format
- Remove any references to legacy config in README or other docs
- Verify linting still works correctly after legacy config removal
- Commit changes with message "chore: remove legacy ESLint configuration files"

### Step 5: Testing and Validation
Comprehensive testing to ensure the ESLint upgrade doesn't break existing workflows or introduce regressions.

#### 5.1: Validate Linting Across Codebase
Ensure ESLint 8 correctly processes all files in the codebase without errors.
- Run `npm run lint` on entire codebase and verify no unexpected errors
- Test linting on different file types (JS, TS, JSX, TSX, JSON)
- Verify ESLint ignores files specified in **.eslintignore**
- Check that custom rules and configurations work as expected
- Document any remaining issues in **docs/eslint-migration-issues.md**

#### 5.2: Update Development Workflow Documentation
Update documentation to reflect ESLint 8 changes and new workflows.
- Update **README.md** with new ESLint version and any workflow changes
- Update **CONTRIBUTING.md** with updated linting guidelines
- Document any new rules or configurations developers should be aware of
- Update IDE setup instructions if ESLint configuration changed
- Commit changes with message "docs: update ESLint documentation for v8"

#### 5.3: Performance and Integration Testing
Verify that ESLint 8 performs well and integrates properly with existing tools.
- Measure and compare linting performance before and after upgrade
- Test integration with pre-commit hooks and CI/CD pipelines
- Verify ESLint works correctly with IDE extensions and editor integrations
- Test that `eslint --fix` functionality works as expected
- Document performance improvements or regressions in migration audit document

## Manual testing plan
- Run `npm run lint` and verify no unexpected errors or warnings appear
- Test ESLint integration in VS Code, WebStorm, or other IDEs used by the team
- Verify pre-commit hooks still work correctly with new ESLint version
- Test `eslint --fix` command fixes issues appropriately without breaking code
- Confirm CI/CD pipeline linting steps pass with new configuration
- Validate that new team members can set up linting following updated documentation
- Test linting performance on large files to ensure no significant slowdown
