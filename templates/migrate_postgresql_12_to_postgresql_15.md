### Step 2: Test Environment Setup and Validation
Establish PostgreSQL 15 test environment and validate migration procedures.

#### 2.1: PostgreSQL 15 Test Environment Installation
Set up a complete PostgreSQL 15 environment for testing and validation.
- Install PostgreSQL 15 on test servers with same OS and hardware specifications

- Install all required extensions compatible with PostgreSQL 15
- Set up monitoring and logging to match production configuration
- Create test database users and permissions matching production
- Validate PostgreSQL 15 installation and basic functionality

#### 2.2: Test Data Migration and Application Validation
Perform complete migration test using production data copy.
- Create full backup of production databases using `pg_dump` with PostgreSQL 12
- Restore backup data to PostgreSQL 15 test environment
- Run comprehensive application test suite against PostgreSQL 15
- Execute all critical business workflows and validate results
- Performance test key queries and operations against PostgreSQL 15
- Document any issues found and create resolution plans

#### 2.3: Migration Procedure Testing and Refinement
Test and optimize the actual migration procedures that will be used in production.
- Test pg_upgrade procedure from PostgreSQL 12 to 15 using production data copy
- Measure migration time and resource requirements for capacity planning
- Validate data integrity after migration using checksums and row counts
- Test rollback procedures and recovery time objectives
- Refine migration scripts and automation based on test results
- Create final migration runbook with exact commands and timing

### Step 3: Application and Configuration Updates
Update application code and configuration files to support PostgreSQL 15.

#### 3.1: Database Connection and Configuration Updates
Update all database connection strings and configuration files for PostgreSQL 15 compatibility.
- Update connection strings in application configuration files to support PostgreSQL 15
- Modify **`database.yml`**, **`.env`**, and other configuration files with new connection parameters
- Update Docker Compose files and Kubernetes manifests with PostgreSQL 15 image versions
- Modify CI/CD pipeline configurations to use PostgreSQL 15 for testing
- Update database migration scripts and schema management tools
- Validate connection pooling and timeout configurations for PostgreSQL 15

#### 3.2: Application Code Compatibility Updates
Modify application code to address PostgreSQL 15 compatibility requirements.
- Update database driver dependencies to versions compatible with PostgreSQL 15
- Modify SQL queries that use deprecated PostgreSQL 12 syntax or functions
- Update stored procedures and functions for PostgreSQL 15 compatibility
- Fix any application code that relies on PostgreSQL 12 specific behavior
- Update database schema migration files if needed for PostgreSQL 15
- Run full test suite to validate all application functionality

#### 3.3: Infrastructure and Deployment Script Updates
Update infrastructure code and deployment scripts for PostgreSQL 15.
- Modify Infrastructure as Code templates (Terraform, CloudFormation) for PostgreSQL 15
- Update deployment scripts and automation tools with PostgreSQL 15 configurations
- Modify backup and restore scripts for PostgreSQL 15 compatibility
- Update monitoring and alerting configurations for PostgreSQL 15 metrics
- Modify log aggregation and analysis tools for PostgreSQL 15 log formats
- Update documentation and runbooks with PostgreSQL 15 specific procedures

### Step 4: Production Migration Execution
Execute the production migration with comprehensive monitoring and validation.

#### 4.1: Pre-Migration Production Preparation
Prepare the production environment for migration with all necessary backups and safety measures.
- Create full production backup using `pg_dumpall` and store in multiple locations
- Verify backup integrity and test restore procedures
- Install PostgreSQL 15 binaries on production servers alongside PostgreSQL 12
- Stop all application services and database connections
- Create additional point-in-time backup immediately before migration
- Validate all migration prerequisites and dependencies are ready

#### 4.2: PostgreSQL Migration Execution
Execute the actual database migration from PostgreSQL 12 to PostgreSQL 15.
- Run `pg_upgrade` command to migrate data from PostgreSQL 12 to PostgreSQL 15
- Monitor migration progress and resource utilization throughout the process
- Validate data integrity using checksums and row count comparisons
- Update PostgreSQL 15 configuration files with production settings
- Start PostgreSQL 15 service and verify successful startup
- Run `ANALYZE` on all tables to update statistics for query optimizer
