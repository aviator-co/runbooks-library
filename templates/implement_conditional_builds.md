# Implement Conditional Builds
Add support for conditional build execution based on environment variables, configuration flags, and runtime conditions to optimize build performance and enable feature-specific builds.

## Summary of changes
- Current build system executes all build steps unconditionally, leading to unnecessary processing time and resource usage
- Implement conditional build logic that can skip or include build steps based on configurable conditions
- Add support for environment-based builds (development, staging, production) with different optimization levels
- Create configuration system for build conditions and feature flags
- Integrate conditional logic into existing build pipeline while maintaining backward compatibility

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Analysis and Configuration Design
Establish the foundation for conditional builds by analyzing current build system and designing the configuration structure.

#### 1.1: Audit Current Build System
Analyze the existing build pipeline to identify optimization opportunities and integration points for conditional logic.
- Review current **build.gradle**, **package.json**, **Makefile**, or equivalent build configuration files
- Document all existing build steps, their dependencies, and execution time
- Identify build steps that could benefit from conditional execution (tests, documentation, asset compilation, etc.)
- Create **docs/build-analysis.md** with findings and recommendations

#### 1.2: Design Conditional Build Configuration Schema
Define the structure and format for conditional build configurations.
- Create **config/build-conditions.schema.json** defining the JSON schema for build conditions
- Design condition types: environment-based, feature-flag-based, file-change-based, and custom conditions
- Define logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) for combining multiple conditions
- Create **docs/conditional-builds-design.md** documenting the configuration format and examples

#### 1.3: Create Build Condition Evaluation Library
Implement core logic for evaluating build conditions and determining which steps should execute.
- Create **src/build/conditions/evaluator.js** (or appropriate language) with condition evaluation logic
- Implement functions for checking environment variables, file changes, and configuration flags
- Add support for logical operators to combine multiple conditions
- Write unit tests in **tests/build/conditions/evaluator.test.js** covering all condition types and edge cases

### Step 2: Configuration Integration
Integrate the conditional build system into the existing build configuration and create management utilities.

#### 2.1: Extend Build Configuration Format
Modify existing build configuration files to support conditional execution directives.
- Update main build configuration file (**build.gradle**, **package.json**, etc.) to include conditional build sections
- Add **conditions** field to build step definitions with references to condition configurations
- Maintain backward compatibility by making conditional fields optional with default "always execute" behavior
- Update configuration validation to handle new conditional fields

#### 2.2: Create Build Condition Management CLI
Develop command-line utilities for managing and testing build conditions.
- Create **scripts/build-conditions.js** with commands for listing, validating, and testing conditions
- Implement `--dry-run` flag to show which build steps would execute without running them
- Add `--condition-debug` flag to display detailed condition evaluation results
- Create help documentation and usage examples within the CLI tool

#### 2.3: Implement Environment-Specific Build Profiles
Create predefined build profiles for common environments and use cases.
- Create **config/build-profiles/development.json** with fast build settings (skip optimization, minimal tests)
- Create **config/build-profiles/staging.json** with moderate optimization and full test suite
- Create **config/build-profiles/production.json** with full optimization and comprehensive validation
- Add profile selection mechanism through environment variables or CLI flags

### Step 3: Build Pipeline Integration
Integrate conditional logic into the existing build pipeline while maintaining current functionality.

#### 3.1: Modify Build Runner
Update the main build execution logic to evaluate conditions before running each build step.
- Modify main build runner (**scripts/build.js** or equivalent) to load and evaluate conditions
- Add condition evaluation before each build step execution
- Implement logging to show which steps are skipped and why
- Ensure error handling for condition evaluation failures with fallback to default behavior

#### 3.2: Update Build Step Definitions
Modify individual build steps to support conditional execution and provide meaningful feedback.
- Update each build step script to check for skip conditions at the beginning
- Add standardized logging format for skipped steps: "Skipping [step-name]: [condition-reason]"
- Implement build step metadata collection for reporting which conditions were evaluated
- Ensure all build steps return appropriate exit codes when skipped vs. executed

#### 3.3: Create Build Reporting System
Implement comprehensive reporting for conditional build execution results.
- Create **src/build/reporting/build-report.js** to generate execution summaries
- Track execution time savings from skipped steps and overall build performance improvements
- Generate JSON and human-readable reports showing executed vs. skipped steps with reasons
- Add integration with existing CI/CD reporting systems if applicable

### Step 4: Testing and Documentation
Comprehensive testing of the conditional build system and creation of user documentation.

#### 4.1: Create Integration Tests
Develop comprehensive tests to verify conditional build behavior across different scenarios.
- Create **tests/integration/conditional-builds.test.js** with end-to-end build scenarios
- Test all condition types (environment, feature flags, file changes) in isolation and combination
- Verify backward compatibility with existing build configurations
- Test error handling and fallback behavior for invalid conditions

#### 4.2: Update Build Documentation
Create comprehensive documentation for developers and build engineers.
- Update **README.md** with quick start guide for conditional builds
- Create **docs/conditional-builds-guide.md** with detailed configuration examples and best practices
- Document all available condition types, operators, and built-in variables
- Add troubleshooting section for common configuration issues and debugging steps

#### 4.3: Create Migration Guide
Develop guidance for teams to adopt conditional builds in existing projects.
- Create **docs/migration-to-conditional-builds.md** with step-by-step migration instructions
- Provide examples of converting common build scenarios to use conditional logic
- Document performance optimization strategies and recommended condition patterns
- Include rollback procedures and compatibility considerations

## Manual testing plan
- Set up test project with various build steps (compilation, testing, documentation, asset processing)
- Test environment-based conditions by setting different **BUILD_ENV** values and verifying correct steps execute
- Verify file-change-based conditions by modifying specific files and confirming only relevant build steps run
- Test feature flag conditions by toggling **FEATURE_FLAGS** and observing build step inclusion/exclusion
- Validate dry-run mode shows accurate execution plan without running actual build steps
- Confirm build performance improvements by comparing execution times with and without conditional logic
- Test error scenarios with invalid conditions and verify graceful fallback to default build behavior
- Verify CI/CD integration by running conditional builds in continuous integration environment
