# Migrate jQuery UI to Modern React Components

Replace legacy jQuery UI widgets with modern React components to improve maintainability, performance, and developer experience.

## Summary of changes

- Identified legacy jQuery UI components (datepicker, dialog, autocomplete, tabs, sortable) scattered across the codebase
- Will replace with modern React equivalents using established libraries like React DatePicker, React Modal, React Select, and React DnD
- Plan includes gradual migration with dual-support during transition to ensure zero downtime
- All existing functionality and styling will be preserved while improving accessibility and mobile responsiveness

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Assessment and Foundation Setup

Establish the migration foundation by auditing existing jQuery UI usage and setting up React component infrastructure.

### 1.1: Audit jQuery UI Components

Perform comprehensive analysis of current jQuery UI usage across the application to create migration roadmap.

- Scan all **JavaScript**, **JSX**, and **HTML** files for jQuery UI widget initializations (`$().datepicker()`, `$().dialog()`, etc.)
- Document each component's current configuration options, event handlers, and styling customizations
- Create inventory spreadsheet with file locations, component types, and complexity ratings
- Identify shared jQuery UI themes and custom CSS overrides that need preservation

### 1.2: Setup React Component Dependencies

Install and configure modern React component libraries that will replace jQuery UI widgets.

- Add **react-datepicker**, **react-modal**, **react-select**, **react-beautiful-dnd** to **package.json**
- Install **@types/** packages for TypeScript support if applicable
- Create **src/components/ui/** directory structure for new React components
- Setup **Storybook** or component documentation system for new React components

### 1.3: [NO-CODE-CHANGE] Create Migration Strategy Document

Document the detailed migration approach and component mapping strategy.

- Create **MIGRATION.md** with jQuery UI to React component mapping table

### 3.2: Create React Sortable Component

Develop drag-and-drop sortable lists replacing jQuery UI sortable with touch support.

- Build **src/components/ui/Sortable.jsx** using react-beautiful-dnd for drag operations
- Implement multi-list sorting, constraint options, and custom drag handles
- Add touch device support and visual feedback during drag operations
- Create **src/components/ui/Sortable.css** matching existing sortable visual indicators
- Write comprehensive tests in **src/components/ui/tests/Sortable.test.jsx** covering drag scenarios

### 3.3: Create Component Export Index

Establish centralized exports for all new React UI components to simplify imports.

- Create **src/components/ui/index.js** exporting all new React components
- Add TypeScript definitions in **src/components/ui/index.d.ts** if applicable
- Update **src/components/index.js** to include UI component exports
- Create component usage documentation in **src/components/ui/README.md**

### Step 4: Gradual Migration Implementation
