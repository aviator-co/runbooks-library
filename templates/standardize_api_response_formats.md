# Standardize API response formats
Implement consistent response structure across all API endpoints to improve client integration and maintainability.

## Summary of changes
- Current API endpoints return inconsistent response formats with varying structures for success/error cases
- Establish a unified response wrapper that includes consistent fields for data, metadata, and error handling
- Update all existing endpoints to use the standardized format while maintaining backward compatibility
- Create comprehensive documentation and validation to ensure future endpoints follow the standard

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Analysis and Design
Establish the foundation for API response standardization by analyzing current state and defining the new standard.

#### 1.1: Audit Current API Response Formats
Conduct a comprehensive analysis of existing API endpoints to understand current response patterns and identify inconsistencies.
- Create **api-response-audit.md** document in **docs/api/** directory
- Scan all controller files in **src/controllers/** and document current response formats
- Identify common patterns, outliers, and inconsistencies in success/error responses
- Categorize endpoints by response type (paginated, single resource, bulk operations, etc.)
- Document breaking changes that would be required for full standardization

#### 1.2: Define Standard Response Format
Create the specification for the new standardized API response format that will be used across all endpoints.
- Create **api-response-standard.md** document in **docs/api/** directory
- Define base response wrapper structure with fields: `data`, `meta`, `errors`, `success`
- Specify format for different response types: single resources, collections, paginated results
- Define error response structure with consistent error codes and messages
- Include examples for each response type and HTTP status code mapping
- Document backward compatibility strategy and migration approach

#### 1.3: Create Response Builder Utility
Implement a centralized utility class to generate standardized API responses consistently across all endpoints.
- Create **src/utils/ResponseBuilder.js** with methods for different response types
- Implement `success()`, `error()`, `paginated()`, and `collection()` methods
- Add TypeScript definitions in **src/types/ApiResponse.ts** for response structures
- Include input validation and sanitization within the response builder
- Add unit tests in **tests/utils/ResponseBuilder.test.js** to verify all response formats

### Step 2: Infrastructure Updates
Update core infrastructure components to support the new response format while maintaining compatibility.

#### 2.1: Update Error Handling Middleware
Modify global error handling to use the standardized response format for all error scenarios.
- Update **src/middleware/errorHandler.js** to use ResponseBuilder for error responses
- Ensure all HTTP error codes map to consistent error response structure
- Add error categorization (validation, authentication, authorization, server errors)
- Update error logging to include standardized error metadata
- Test error handling with **tests/middleware/errorHandler.test.js**

#### 2.2: Create Response Format Validation Middleware
Implement middleware to validate that all API responses conform to the standard format.
- Create **src/middleware/responseValidator.js** for development/testing environments
- Add JSON schema validation for response structure compliance
- Include logging for non-compliant responses during development
- Create configuration flag to enable/disable validation in different environments
- Add tests in **tests/middleware/responseValidator.test.js**

#### 2.3: Update API Documentation Generator
Modify API documentation tools to reflect the new standardized response formats.
- Update **swagger.config.js** to include standard response schemas
- Create reusable OpenAPI components for common response structures
- Update existing endpoint documentation to show new response format examples
- Add response format validation to API documentation build process
- Generate updated API documentation and verify all examples are correct

### Step 3: Endpoint Migration - Core Resources
Migrate core resource endpoints to use the standardized response format while maintaining backward compatibility.

#### 3.1: Update User Management Endpoints
Convert user-related API endpoints to use the new standardized response format.
- Update **src/controllers/UserController.js** methods to use ResponseBuilder
- Modify user creation, update, deletion, and retrieval endpoints
- Update **src/routes/users.js** to include response format headers
- Add backward compatibility layer for existing clients expecting old format
- Update tests in **tests/controllers/UserController.test.js** for new response format

#### 3.2: Update Authentication Endpoints
Standardize authentication and authorization endpoint responses.
- Update **src/controllers/AuthController.js** login, logout, and token refresh endpoints
- Ensure error responses for authentication failures use standard format
- Update password reset and email verification endpoints
- Maintain security considerations while standardizing response structure
- Update authentication tests in **tests/controllers/AuthController.test.js**

#### 3.3: Update Resource CRUD Endpoints
Convert remaining core resource endpoints to use standardized responses.
- Update **src/controllers/ProductController.js**, **OrderController.js**, and similar core resources
- Implement pagination using standard format for list endpoints
- Update bulk operation endpoints to use consistent success/error reporting
- Add proper metadata for resource operations (timestamps, version info)
- Update corresponding test files for each controller

### Step 4: Endpoint Migration - Secondary Resources
Complete the migration by updating remaining endpoints and implementing validation.

#### 4.1: Update Reporting and Analytics Endpoints
Standardize responses for data-heavy endpoints like reports and analytics.
- Update **src/controllers/ReportsController.js** and **AnalyticsController.js**
- Handle large dataset responses with proper pagination and metadata
- Standardize chart data and statistical information formatting
- Update export functionality to include standard response wrappers
- Update tests for reporting endpoints

#### 4.2: Update Integration and Webhook Endpoints
Standardize external integration and webhook endpoint responses.
- Update **src/controllers/WebhookController.js** and integration controllers
- Ensure third-party API responses are wrapped in standard format
- Update webhook payload validation and response formatting
- Maintain compatibility with external systems expecting specific formats
- Add integration tests for webhook and external API interactions

#### 4.3: Implement Response Format Enforcement
Add validation and enforcement mechanisms to ensure all new endpoints use the standard format.
- Create pre-commit hooks to validate response format compliance
- Add ESLint rules to enforce ResponseBuilder usage in controllers
- Update code review checklist to include response format verification
- Create automated tests to scan for non-compliant response formats
- Document enforcement procedures in **docs/development/api-standards.md**

### Step 5: Documentation and Rollout
Complete the standardization with comprehensive documentation and gradual rollout procedures.

#### 5.1: Create Migration Guide for Clients
Develop comprehensive documentation to help API clients migrate to the new response format.
- Create **docs/api/migration-guide.md** with before/after examples
- Document breaking changes and required client-side modifications
- Provide code samples for common client libraries (JavaScript, Python, etc.)
- Include timeline for backward compatibility deprecation

#### 5.2: Update Development Guidelines
Establish development standards and guidelines for maintaining response format consistency.
- Update **docs/development/api-development-guide.md** with response format requirements
- Create code templates and snippets for common endpoint patterns
- Document testing procedures for response format compliance
- Add response format considerations to API design review process
- Include examples of proper ResponseBuilder usage patterns

#### 5.3: Implement Gradual Rollout Strategy
Create a controlled rollout plan to deploy standardized responses without breaking existing clients.

- Document rollback procedures in case of critical issues

## Manual testing plan
- Test each migrated endpoint using API testing tools (Postman, curl) to verify response format compliance
- Validate error scenarios return properly formatted error responses with correct HTTP status codes
- Test pagination functionality with various page sizes and verify metadata accuracy
- Verify backward compatibility by testing with existing client applications
- Test response format validation middleware in development environment
- Validate API documentation accuracy by comparing generated docs with actual endpoint responses
- Test feature flag functionality to ensure smooth transition between old and new formats
- Verify webhook and integration endpoints maintain compatibility with external systems
- Test bulk operations and ensure proper success/error reporting for partial failures
- Validate response times and performance impact of the new response format structure
