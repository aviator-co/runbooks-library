# Migrate jQuery to vanilla JavaScript
Remove jQuery dependency and replace all jQuery usage with native JavaScript APIs to reduce bundle size and improve performance.

## Summary of changes
- Audit current jQuery usage across the codebase to identify all dependencies and usage patterns
- Replace jQuery DOM manipulation, event handling, AJAX calls, and utility functions with vanilla JavaScript equivalents
- Update build configuration to remove jQuery from dependencies
- Ensure all existing functionality remains intact while improving performance and reducing bundle size

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Analysis and Planning
Comprehensive analysis of current jQuery usage to create a migration strategy.

#### 1.1: jQuery Usage Audit
Create a comprehensive audit of all jQuery usage in the codebase to understand the scope of migration.
- Search for all `$` and `jQuery` references across JavaScript, TypeScript, and template files
- Document jQuery methods used (DOM manipulation, events, AJAX, utilities) in **jquery-audit.md**
- Identify third-party libraries that depend on jQuery
- Create inventory of custom jQuery plugins and extensions
- Estimate complexity and effort for each usage category

#### 1.2: Migration Strategy Documentation
Develop a detailed migration strategy based on the audit findings.
- Create **jquery-migration-strategy.md** documenting replacement patterns for each jQuery method
- Define coding standards for vanilla JavaScript replacements
- Identify high-risk areas that require careful testing
- Plan rollback strategy in case of critical issues
- Document browser compatibility requirements and polyfills needed

#### 1.3: Test Coverage Assessment
Evaluate current test coverage for jQuery-dependent code to ensure safe migration.
- Review existing unit and integration tests covering jQuery functionality
- Identify gaps in test coverage for jQuery-dependent features
- Document additional test cases needed in **jquery-test-coverage.md**
- Plan test enhancement strategy to cover migration changes

### Step 2: Utility Functions Migration
Replace jQuery utility functions with vanilla JavaScript equivalents.

#### 2.1: DOM Query and Manipulation Utilities
Create vanilla JavaScript utility functions to replace common jQuery DOM operations.
- Create **src/utils/dom.js** with functions for `querySelector`, `querySelectorAll` replacements
- Implement utilities for DOM manipulation: `addClass`, `removeClass`, `toggleClass`, `hasClass`
- Add functions for element creation, insertion, and removal
- Create utilities for getting/setting element attributes and properties
- Write unit tests in **tests/utils/dom.test.js** for all utility functions

#### 2.2: Event Handling Utilities
Implement vanilla JavaScript event handling to replace jQuery event methods.
- Add event utilities to **src/utils/events.js** for `addEventListener`, `removeEventListener` wrappers
- Create event delegation utility functions
- Implement custom event creation and triggering utilities
- Add support for event namespacing if used in current jQuery code
- Write comprehensive tests in **tests/utils/events.test.js**

#### 2.3: AJAX and HTTP Utilities
Replace jQuery AJAX functionality with modern fetch API or XMLHttpRequest.
- Create **src/utils/http.js** with fetch-based utilities mimicking jQuery AJAX methods
- Implement functions for GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests with similar API to `$.ajax()`
- Add support for request/response interceptors if currently used
- Handle error cases and response parsing consistently
- Write tests in **tests/utils/http.test.js** covering all HTTP scenarios

### Step 3: Core Application Migration
Migrate main application code from jQuery to vanilla JavaScript.

#### 3.1: Component-by-Component Migration
Systematically migrate individual components from jQuery to vanilla JavaScript.
- Start with leaf components that have minimal dependencies
- Replace jQuery selectors with `document.querySelector` and `document.querySelectorAll`
- Convert jQuery event handlers to native `addEventListener`
- Replace jQuery DOM manipulation with native methods
- Update each component's tests to work with vanilla JavaScript
- Ensure each component works independently after migration

#### 3.2: Form Handling Migration
Convert jQuery form handling to vanilla JavaScript.
- Replace jQuery form selectors and validation with native form API
- Convert form submission handlers from jQuery to vanilla JavaScript
- Update form data serialization from jQuery methods to `FormData` API
- Migrate form validation logic to use native constraint validation API
- Test all form interactions thoroughly after migration

#### 3.3: Animation and Effects Migration
Replace jQuery animations with CSS transitions and Web Animations API.
- Identify all jQuery animation usage (`fadeIn`, `fadeOut`, `slideUp`, `slideDown`, etc.)
- Create CSS classes for common animations previously handled by jQuery
- Implement JavaScript functions using Web Animations API for complex animations
- Update animation triggers to use vanilla JavaScript event handling
- Ensure animation performance is maintained or improved

### Step 4: Third-party Integration Updates
Update third-party library integrations that depend on jQuery.

#### 4.1: Plugin Replacement Assessment
Evaluate and replace jQuery plugins with vanilla JavaScript alternatives.
- Research vanilla JavaScript alternatives for each jQuery plugin currently used
- Create **plugin-alternatives.md** documenting replacement options and migration paths
- Prioritize plugins by usage frequency and migration complexity
- Plan gradual replacement strategy to minimize disruption

#### 4.2: Plugin Migration Implementation
Replace jQuery plugins with vanilla JavaScript alternatives or custom implementations.
- Install and configure vanilla JavaScript alternatives for critical plugins
- Implement custom vanilla JavaScript solutions for simple plugins
- Update plugin initialization code to work without jQuery
- Migrate plugin configuration and event handling
- Test plugin functionality thoroughly in all usage contexts

### Step 5: Build Configuration Updates
Update build tools and configuration to remove jQuery dependency.

#### 5.1: Dependency Cleanup
Remove jQuery from project dependencies and update build configuration.
- Remove jQuery from **package.json** dependencies
- Update webpack/build configuration to remove jQuery global exposure
- Remove jQuery from any CDN references in HTML templates
- Update any build scripts that reference jQuery
- Clean up any jQuery-related build optimizations or configurations

#### 5.2: Bundle Analysis and Optimization
Analyze bundle size improvements and optimize the new vanilla JavaScript code.
- Run bundle analysis to measure size reduction from jQuery removal
- Optimize new utility functions for tree-shaking
- Ensure no dead code remains from jQuery migration
- Update code splitting configuration if needed
- Document bundle size improvements in **migration-results.md**

### Step 6: Testing and Validation
Comprehensive testing of the migrated codebase to ensure functionality is preserved.

#### 6.1: Automated Test Updates
Update all automated tests to work with the new vanilla JavaScript implementation.
- Update unit tests that mock jQuery to use vanilla JavaScript mocks
- Fix integration tests that rely on jQuery behavior
- Update end-to-end tests that interact with jQuery-dependent features
- Ensure test coverage remains at or above previous levels
- Run full test suite to verify no regressions

#### 6.2: Cross-browser Compatibility Testing
Verify that vanilla JavaScript implementation works across all supported browsers.
- Test core functionality in all target browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Verify polyfills work correctly for older browser support
- Test on mobile browsers if applicable
- Document any browser-specific issues and solutions
- Update browser support documentation if needed

## Manual testing plan
- Test all interactive features (forms, buttons, modals, dropdowns) across different browsers
- Verify animations and transitions work smoothly and match previous jQuery behavior
- Test AJAX functionality including error handling and loading states
- Validate form submissions, validation, and error messaging
- Check responsive behavior and mobile interactions
- Test keyboard navigation and accessibility features
- Verify third-party integrations still function correctly
- Performance test page load times and interaction responsiveness
- Test edge cases like rapid clicking, network failures, and large datasets
