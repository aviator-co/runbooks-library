# Kubernetes Migration from 1.20 to 1.25
Comprehensive migration plan to upgrade Kubernetes cluster from version 1.20 to 1.25 with minimal downtime and risk mitigation.

## Summary of changes
- Current cluster running on Kubernetes 1.20 which is approaching end-of-life support
- Migration will be performed incrementally through versions 1.21, 1.22, 1.23, 1.24, and finally 1.25
- Deprecated APIs and features will be identified and updated before each version upgrade
- Control plane components will be upgraded before worker nodes to maintain compatibility
- Backup and rollback procedures will be established for each upgrade step

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Pre-Migration Assessment and Planning
Comprehensive analysis of current cluster state and preparation for migration process.

#### 1.1: Cluster Inventory and Compatibility Audit
Document current cluster configuration and identify potential compatibility issues across all target versions.
- Create **cluster-inventory.md** in **docs/kubernetes-migration/** directory with current cluster specs, node counts, and resource utilization
- Run `kubectl api-resources` and document all custom resources and their API versions in **api-resources-audit.md**
- Execute `kubectl get all --all-namespaces -o yaml > current-cluster-state.yaml` to capture complete cluster state
- Use `pluto detect-files --directory .` to identify deprecated APIs in manifests and Helm charts
- Document findings in **deprecated-apis-report.md** with remediation plan for each deprecated resource

#### 1.2: Backup Strategy Implementation
Establish comprehensive backup procedures for cluster state and persistent data.
- Create **backup-restore-procedures.md** documenting etcd backup, persistent volume snapshots, and configuration backup steps
- Implement automated etcd backup script in **scripts/backup-etcd.sh** with retention policy
- Create **scripts/backup-cluster-configs.sh** to backup all ConfigMaps, Secrets, and custom resources
- Test backup restoration procedure on staging environment and document results in **backup-test-results.md**
- Set up monitoring alerts for backup job failures in **monitoring/backup-alerts.yaml**

#### 1.3: Version-Specific Breaking Changes Analysis
Research and document breaking changes for each target Kubernetes version.
- Create **version-breaking-changes.md** documenting API deprecations, feature removals, and behavioral changes for versions 1.21-1.25
