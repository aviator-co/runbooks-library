# Optimize Maven dependency resolution

Improve build performance by optimizing dependency resolution, reducing conflicts, and implementing better caching strategies.

## Summary of changes

- Current Maven builds show slow dependency resolution times and potential version conflicts
- Implement dependency management best practices including BOM usage and version alignment
- Add dependency analysis tools and optimize repository configurations
- Configure advanced caching and parallel resolution strategies

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Dependency Analysis and Cleanup

Establish baseline metrics and identify problematic dependencies before making optimizations.

### 1.1: Add dependency analysis plugins

Add Maven plugins to analyze current dependency tree and identify optimization opportunities.

- Add **maven-dependency-plugin** version 3.6.0 to **pom.xml** in `<build><plugins>` section
- Add **versions-maven-plugin** version 2.16.0 to **pom.xml** for version management
- Add **duplicate-finder-maven-plugin** version 2.0.1 to detect duplicate dependencies
- Configure plugins to run in **validate** phase with appropriate goals

### 1.2: Generate dependency reports

Create comprehensive reports to understand current dependency landscape.

- Run `mvn dependency:tree -Dverbose=true` to generate full dependency tree with conflicts
- Run `mvn dependency:analyze` to identify unused and undeclared dependencies
- Run `mvn versions:display-dependency-updates` to check for available updates
- Save reports to **target/dependency-reports/** directory for analysis

### 1.3: [NO-CODE-CHANGE] Document current state

Document baseline metrics and identify optimization targets.

- Record current build times for dependency resolution phase
- Identify top 10 dependencies with most transitive dependencies
- List all version conflicts found in dependency tree analysis
- Create optimization priority list based on impact and complexity

### Step 2: Repository Optimization

Configure Maven repositories for optimal performance and reliability.

### 2.1: Optimize repository configuration

Update repository settings to improve resolution speed and reliability.

- Add **maven-central** repository with HTTPS URL in **pom.xml** `<repositories>` section
- Configure repository with `<releases><enabled>true</enabled></releases>` and `<snapshots><enabled>false</enabled></snapshots>`
- Add **spring-milestones** repository if using Spring dependencies with appropriate snapshot settings
- Remove any duplicate or unused repository configurations from **pom.xml**

### 2.2: Configure repository mirrors

Set up repository mirrors in Maven settings for better performance.

- Create or update **~/.m2/settings.xml** with mirror configuration for central repository
- Add mirror URL pointing to fastest available Maven mirror (e.g., **repo1.maven.org**)
- Configure mirror with `<mirrorOf>central</mirrorOf>` to redirect central requests
- Test repository accessibility with `mvn dependency:resolve-sources`

### Step 3: Dependency Management Implementation

Implement centralized dependency management to reduce conflicts and improve consistency.

### 3.1: Create dependency management BOM

Establish Bill of Materials for consistent dependency versions across modules.

- Create new **dependency-bom** module in project root with **pom** packaging
- Add `<dependencyManagement>` section with all major dependencies and their versions
- Include popular BOMs like **spring-boot-dependencies** and **junit-bom** as imports
- Version all dependencies explicitly to avoid version resolution conflicts

### 3.2: Update module POMs to use BOM

Modify existing module POMs to leverage centralized dependency management.

- Add **dependency-bom** as import in `<dependencyManagement><dependencies>` section of parent POM
- Remove version specifications from `<dependencies>` sections in all child modules
- Update all module POMs to inherit versions from BOM instead of declaring them locally
- Run `mvn dependency:tree` to verify no version conflicts remain

### 3.3: Implement dependency exclusions

Add strategic exclusions to prevent problematic transitive dependencies.

- Identify conflicting transitive dependencies from previous analysis reports
- Add `<exclusions>` blocks to dependencies that bring in conflicting versions
- Exclude common problematic dependencies like **commons-logging** and **log4j-over-slf4j** conflicts
- Verify exclusions don't break functionality by running full test suite

### Step 4: Performance Optimization

Configure advanced Maven settings for faster dependency resolution.

### 4.1: Enable parallel dependency resolution

Configure Maven to resolve dependencies in parallel for improved performance.

- Add `T 4C` (4 threads per CPU core) to **MAVEN_OPTS** environment variable
- Update **pom.xml** to include `<maven.resolver.transport>wagon</maven.resolver.transport>` property
- Configure connection pooling with `<maven.wagon.http.pool>true</maven.wagon.http.pool>` property
- Test parallel resolution doesn't introduce race conditions in build

### 4.2: Optimize local repository caching

Configure local repository for optimal caching and cleanup strategies.

- Add **maven-clean-plugin** configuration to preserve dependency cache during clean
- Configure `<localRepository>` path in **settings.xml** if using custom location
- Set up periodic cleanup job with `mvn dependency:purge-local-repository` for outdated snapshots
- Add `.m2/repository` to backup procedures to preserve dependency cache

### 4.3: Configure dependency resolution timeouts

Set appropriate timeouts to prevent hanging builds while maintaining reliability.

- Add `<maven.wagon.http.connectionTimeout>10000</maven.wagon.http.connectionTimeout>` property to **pom.xml**
- Set `<maven.wagon.http.readTimeout>30000</maven.wagon.http.readTimeout>` for read operations
- Configure retry logic with `<maven.wagon.http.retryHandler.count>3</maven.wagon.http.retryHandler.count>`
- Add connection pool configuration with reasonable maximum connections per route

### Step 5: Build Integration and Monitoring

Integrate optimization changes with build pipeline and add monitoring capabilities.

### 5.1: Update CI/CD configuration

Modify continuous integration setup to leverage dependency optimizations.

- Update CI build scripts to use optimized **MAVEN_OPTS** with parallel resolution flags
- Configure CI to cache **~/.m2/repository** directory between builds
- Add dependency resolution time monitoring to build metrics collection
- Update build agents with optimized **settings.xml** configuration

### 5.2: Add dependency monitoring

Implement monitoring and alerting for dependency-related issues.

- Add **maven-enforcer-plugin** rules to prevent dependency conflicts
- Configure rules for banned dependencies, required versions, and duplicate classes
- Add **dependency-check-maven** plugin for security vulnerability scanning
- Set up automated reports for dependency updates and security issues

## Manual testing plan

- Execute full build with `mvn clean install -T 4C` and measure total build time compared to baseline
- Verify no dependency conflicts by running `mvn dependency:tree` and checking for version warnings
- Test application startup and functionality to ensure no runtime dependencies are missing
- Validate repository accessibility by clearing local cache and running `mvn dependency:resolve`
- Confirm parallel resolution works by monitoring CPU usage during dependency resolution phase
- Test build reproducibility by running builds on clean environments multiple times
