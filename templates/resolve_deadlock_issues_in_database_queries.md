# Database Deadlock Resolution Runbook
Comprehensive plan to identify, analyze, and resolve deadlock issues in database queries through monitoring, optimization, and preventive measures.

## Summary of changes
- Current database operations lack proper deadlock detection and monitoring capabilities
- Multiple concurrent transactions are likely accessing resources in inconsistent order causing deadlocks
- Query execution plans and indexing strategies need optimization to reduce lock contention
- Application-level retry mechanisms and transaction isolation improvements are required
- Comprehensive logging and alerting system needed for proactive deadlock management

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Analysis and Documentation
Initial assessment phase to understand current deadlock patterns and establish baseline metrics.

#### 1.1: Database Deadlock Audit
Create comprehensive analysis of existing deadlock patterns and frequency to establish current state baseline.
- Enable deadlock monitoring in database configuration (SQL Server: trace flag 1222, PostgreSQL: log_lock_waits)
- Collect deadlock logs from the past 30 days from database error logs and system tables
- Create **deadlock_analysis.md** document with findings including frequency, affected tables, and common query patterns
- Document current transaction isolation levels and locking strategies in **current_db_config.md**

#### 1.2: Query Performance Analysis
Analyze slow and problematic queries that contribute to lock contention and deadlock scenarios.
- Run database performance monitoring tools (pg_stat_statements, SQL Server Query Store) to identify top resource-consuming queries
- Document queries with high lock wait times and blocking patterns in **query_performance_report.md**
- Create execution plan analysis for top 20 problematic queries showing lock acquisition patterns
- Identify missing indexes that could reduce lock duration using database advisor tools

#### 1.3: Application Code Review
Review application code to identify transaction patterns and potential deadlock-prone code sections.
- Audit all database transaction code in application codebase for consistent resource access ordering
- Document current retry logic and error handling patterns in **transaction_patterns.md**
- Identify long-running transactions and nested transaction scenarios
- Map application workflows to database lock acquisition patterns

### Step 2: Monitoring Infrastructure
Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting system for deadlock detection and analysis.

#### 2.1: Database Monitoring Setup
Implement database-level monitoring for deadlock detection and performance metrics collection.
- Create **db_monitoring/deadlock_monitor.sql** script to capture deadlock graphs and victim information
- Set up automated deadlock log collection job that runs every 5 minutes
- Configure database alerts for deadlock threshold exceeded (more than 5 deadlocks per hour)
- Create **db_monitoring/performance_metrics.sql** for lock wait statistics and blocking session monitoring

#### 2.2: Application Monitoring Integration
Add application-level monitoring and logging for database deadlock scenarios and retry attempts.
- Create **src/monitoring/deadlock_logger.py** (or appropriate language) for structured deadlock event logging
- Implement deadlock detection in database connection error handling with specific error codes
- Add metrics collection for deadlock retry attempts and success rates using existing metrics framework
- Create dashboard configuration in **monitoring/dashboards/deadlock_dashboard.json** for real-time deadlock monitoring

#### 2.3: Alerting System Configuration
Set up proactive alerting system for deadlock incidents and performance degradation.
- Configure alert rules in **monitoring/alerts/deadlock_alerts.yaml** for deadlock frequency thresholds
- Set up notification channels for database team and on-call engineers
- Create escalation policies for repeated deadlock incidents affecting critical transactions
- Implement alert correlation to prevent notification spam during deadlock storms

### Step 3: Database Optimization
Optimize database schema, indexes, and configuration to reduce deadlock probability.

#### 3.1: Index Optimization
Create and optimize indexes to reduce lock duration and improve query performance.
- Implement missing indexes identified in analysis phase using **db_migrations/001_add_performance_indexes.sql**
- Create covering indexes for frequently accessed columns to reduce page-level locks
- Add index hints or force index usage in problematic queries where appropriate
- Update database statistics and rebuild fragmented indexes to ensure optimal execution plans

#### 3.2: Query Optimization
Refactor problematic queries to reduce lock contention and improve execution efficiency.
- Rewrite queries in **db_queries/** directory to access tables in consistent order (alphabetical by table name)
- Implement query hints (NOLOCK, READ UNCOMMITTED where appropriate) for read-heavy operations
- Break down large batch operations into smaller chunks with intermediate commits
- Add explicit transaction boundaries and reduce transaction scope in application code

#### 3.3: Database Configuration Tuning
Optimize database server configuration parameters to minimize deadlock occurrence.
- Adjust lock timeout settings in **db_config/database_settings.conf** (lock_timeout, deadlock_timeout)
- Configure appropriate transaction isolation levels for different operation types
- Tune memory allocation for lock manager and buffer pool to reduce lock escalation
- Enable read committed snapshot isolation where applicable to reduce reader-writer conflicts

### Step 4: Application-Level Improvements
Implement application-level deadlock handling and prevention mechanisms.

#### 4.1: Retry Mechanism Implementation
Implement robust retry logic with exponential backoff for deadlock scenarios.
- Create **src/database/deadlock_retry_decorator.py** with configurable retry attempts and backoff strategy
- Implement deadlock-specific error detection and retry logic in database access layer
- Add jitter to retry intervals to prevent thundering herd problems
- Create unit tests in **tests/database/test_deadlock_retry.py** for retry mechanism validation

#### 4.2: Transaction Management Refactoring
Refactor transaction management to follow consistent patterns and reduce deadlock probability.
- Implement consistent resource ordering in **src/database/transaction_manager.py** for all multi-table operations
- Reduce transaction scope by moving non-critical operations outside transaction boundaries
- Implement transaction timeout mechanisms to prevent long-running transactions
- Add transaction context managers with proper cleanup and rollback handling

#### 4.3: Connection Pool Optimization
Optimize database connection pooling to reduce connection-related deadlocks and improve resource utilization.
- Configure connection pool settings in **config/database.yaml** with appropriate min/max connections
- Implement connection health checks and automatic connection recycling
- Add connection pool monitoring and alerting for pool exhaustion scenarios
- Configure statement timeout and connection timeout values to prevent hanging connections

### Step 5: Testing and Validation
Comprehensive testing framework to validate deadlock resolution and prevent regressions.

#### 5.1: Deadlock Simulation Testing
Create automated tests that simulate deadlock scenarios to validate resolution mechanisms.
- Develop **tests/integration/deadlock_simulation.py** with concurrent transaction scenarios
- Create test cases for different deadlock patterns (circular wait, lock escalation, reader-writer conflicts)
- Implement load testing scenarios that reproduce historical deadlock conditions
- Add performance benchmarks to measure improvement in deadlock frequency and resolution time

#### 5.2: Regression Testing Suite
