# Build Artifact Sharing Setup
Implement a centralized build artifact sharing system to enable efficient distribution and caching of build outputs across development teams and CI/CD pipelines.

## Summary of changes
- Current build system lacks centralized artifact storage, leading to redundant builds and slow development cycles
- Implement artifact repository with proper versioning, metadata, and access controls
- Add build pipeline integration for automatic artifact publishing and consumption
- Create developer tooling for local artifact management and sharing workflows

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Infrastructure and Repository Setup
Establish the foundational infrastructure for artifact storage and management.

#### 1.1: Artifact Repository Selection and Configuration
Evaluate and configure the artifact repository solution based on project requirements and existing infrastructure.
- Research and document comparison of artifact repository solutions (Nexus, Artifactory, AWS CodeArtifact, GitHub Packages)
- Create **infrastructure/artifact-repo-config.md** with selected solution rationale and configuration requirements
- Set up artifact repository instance with basic authentication and storage configuration
- Configure repository policies for retention, cleanup, and access permissions
- Create initial repository structure with appropriate naming conventions for different artifact types

#### 1.2: Network and Security Configuration
Configure secure access and network policies for the artifact repository.
- Set up SSL certificates and HTTPS endpoints for secure artifact access
- Configure firewall rules and network access policies for repository access
- Implement authentication integration with existing identity provider (LDAP, OAuth, etc.)
- Create service accounts and API keys for CI/CD pipeline access
- Document security policies and access control matrix in **docs/artifact-security-policies.md**

#### 1.3: Storage and Backup Strategy
Establish reliable storage and disaster recovery for build artifacts.
- Configure storage backend with appropriate redundancy and performance characteristics
- Set up automated backup procedures for artifact metadata and critical builds
- Implement storage quota management and monitoring alerts
- Create disaster recovery procedures documented in **docs/artifact-backup-recovery.md**
- Test backup and restore procedures to ensure reliability

### Step 2: Build System Integration
Integrate artifact publishing and consumption into existing build pipelines.

#### 2.1: Artifact Publishing Pipeline
Implement automated artifact publishing from CI/CD builds.
- Create **scripts/publish-artifacts.sh** script for artifact upload with metadata
- Add artifact publishing steps to existing CI/CD pipeline configuration files
- Implement artifact versioning strategy using semantic versioning or build numbers
- Add build metadata collection (commit hash, build timestamp, dependencies) to artifact publishing
- Configure pipeline to publish artifacts only on successful builds and tests

#### 2.2: Artifact Consumption Framework
Create tooling for consuming published artifacts in builds and deployments.
- Develop **scripts/fetch-artifacts.sh** script for downloading and caching artifacts locally
- Implement artifact resolution logic with fallback strategies for missing artifacts
- Add artifact dependency declaration format in build configuration files
- Create artifact verification mechanisms using checksums and digital signatures
- Update existing build scripts to use shared artifacts instead of rebuilding dependencies

#### 2.3: Local Development Integration
Enable developers to leverage shared artifacts in local development environments.
- Create **tools/dev-artifact-manager** CLI tool for local artifact management
- Implement local artifact cache with automatic cleanup and size management
- Add IDE integration scripts for popular development environments
- Create developer documentation in **docs/developer-artifact-guide.md** with usage examples
- Implement artifact search and discovery functionality for developers

### Step 3: Monitoring and Governance
Establish monitoring, metrics, and governance processes for artifact management.

#### 3.1: Monitoring and Metrics Implementation
Set up comprehensive monitoring for artifact repository health and usage.
- Implement artifact repository health checks and uptime monitoring
- Create dashboards for artifact usage metrics, storage consumption, and download statistics
- Set up alerting for repository failures, storage quota violations, and unusual access patterns
- Add build pipeline metrics for artifact publish/consume success rates and timing
- Create weekly/monthly artifact usage reports for team visibility

#### 3.2: Governance and Lifecycle Management
Establish policies and procedures for artifact lifecycle management.
- Create **docs/artifact-governance-policy.md** with retention policies and approval workflows
- Implement automated cleanup procedures for old or unused artifacts
- Set up artifact promotion workflows for different environments (dev, staging, production)
- Create artifact deprecation and migration procedures for breaking changes
- Establish artifact security scanning and vulnerability management processes

#### 3.3: Documentation and Training Materials
Create comprehensive documentation and training resources for artifact sharing system.
- Develop **docs/artifact-sharing-overview.md** with system architecture and workflows
- Create troubleshooting guide in **docs/artifact-troubleshooting.md** for common issues
- Produce video tutorials and training materials for development teams
- Set up artifact sharing best practices documentation with examples and anti-patterns
- Create onboarding checklist for new team members using the artifact system

## Manual testing plan
- Verify artifact repository accessibility from different network locations and user accounts
- Test artifact publishing workflow by manually triggering builds and confirming uploads
- Validate artifact consumption by creating a test project that depends on shared artifacts
- Test local development workflow by setting up a new development environment using shared artifacts
- Verify backup and restore procedures by performing a controlled disaster recovery test
- Test access controls by attempting to access artifacts with different user permission levels
- Validate monitoring and alerting by simulating repository failures and storage quota issues
- Test artifact search and discovery functionality with various query patterns and filters
