# Migrate HTTP to HTTPS Protocol
Comprehensive migration from HTTP to HTTPS across the entire application stack with SSL/TLS certificate management and security hardening.

## Summary of changes
- Current application serves traffic over insecure HTTP protocol exposing data transmission vulnerabilities
- Migration requires SSL/TLS certificate acquisition, web server configuration updates, application URL updates, and security policy enforcement
- Implementation includes graceful HTTP to HTTPS redirection, HSTS headers, and comprehensive testing across all environments
- Database connection strings, API endpoints, and third-party integrations need protocol updates

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: SSL Certificate Management and Infrastructure Setup
Establish SSL/TLS certificates and prepare infrastructure components for HTTPS support.

#### 1.1: SSL Certificate Acquisition and Validation
Obtain and validate SSL/TLS certificates for all application domains and subdomains.
- Generate Certificate Signing Request (CSR) for primary domain and all subdomains
- Purchase or obtain SSL certificates from Certificate Authority (CA) or configure Let's Encrypt
- Validate certificate chain and private key integrity using openssl commands
- Store certificates securely in **certificates/** directory with proper file permissions (600)
- Create certificate renewal automation script in **scripts/renew-certificates.sh**

#### 1.2: Load Balancer and Reverse Proxy Configuration
Configure load balancers and reverse proxies to handle HTTPS traffic and SSL termination.
- Update **nginx.conf** or **apache.conf** to add HTTPS virtual hosts on port 443
- Configure SSL certificate paths and private key locations in web server configuration
- Add SSL/TLS security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options)
- Set up HTTP to HTTPS redirect rules with 301 permanent redirect status
- Update health check endpoints to support both HTTP and HTTPS protocols

#### 1.3: Environment Configuration Updates
Update environment-specific configuration files to support HTTPS protocol across all deployment environments.
- Modify **config/production.yml** to set `force_ssl: true` and `protocol: https`
- Update **config/staging.yml** and **config/development.yml** with HTTPS settings
- Configure environment variables for SSL certificate paths in **.env** files
- Update **docker-compose.yml** to expose port 443 and mount certificate volumes
- Modify Kubernetes **deployment.yaml** and **service.yaml** to handle HTTPS traffic

### Step 2: Application Code Migration
Update application code to use HTTPS URLs and implement security middleware.

#### 2.1: URL Configuration and Hardcoded Links Update
Replace all HTTP references with HTTPS throughout the application codebase.
- Update **config/application.rb** or equivalent to set `config.force_ssl = true`
- Search and replace all hardcoded HTTP URLs in templates, views, and configuration files
- Update **routes.rb** or routing configuration to enforce HTTPS for sensitive endpoints
- Modify **constants.rb** or configuration constants to use HTTPS base URLs
- Update API client configurations to use HTTPS endpoints

#### 2.2: Security Middleware Implementation
Implement HTTPS security middleware and headers across the application.
- Add HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) middleware in **middleware/security.rb**
- Implement secure cookie flags (Secure, SameSite) in session configuration
- Update CORS configuration to allow HTTPS origins in **config/cors.rb**
- Add Content Security Policy headers with HTTPS-only directives
- Configure secure WebSocket connections (WSS) in **config/cable.yml**

#### 2.3: Database and External Service Configuration
Update database connections and external service integrations to use secure protocols.
- Modify database connection strings in **config/database.yml** to use SSL connections
- Update Redis configuration in **config/redis.yml** to use TLS connections
- Configure external API clients to use HTTPS endpoints in **lib/external_apis/**
- Update webhook URLs and callback endpoints to use HTTPS protocol
- Modify email templates and notification services to use HTTPS links

### Step 3: Testing and Validation Framework
Implement comprehensive testing to ensure HTTPS migration works correctly across all components.

#### 3.1: Automated Test Suite Updates
Update existing test suites to work with HTTPS protocol and add HTTPS-specific tests.
- Modify **test/integration/** tests to use HTTPS URLs and verify SSL connections
- Update **spec/requests/** tests to include HTTPS protocol and security headers validation
- Add SSL certificate validation tests in **test/security/ssl_test.rb**
- Create HTTPS redirect tests to verify HTTP to HTTPS redirection works correctly
- Update API integration tests to use HTTPS endpoints and verify SSL handshake

#### 3.2: Security Validation Tests
Create comprehensive security tests to validate HTTPS implementation and SSL configuration.
- Implement SSL Labs API integration test in **test/security/ssl_labs_test.rb**
- Add HSTS header validation tests in **test/security/headers_test.rb**
- Create mixed content detection tests to ensure no HTTP resources on HTTPS pages
- Implement certificate expiration monitoring tests in **test/monitoring/cert_expiry_test.rb**
- Add WebSocket secure connection tests in **test/websockets/secure_connection_test.rb**

#### 3.3: Performance and Load Testing
Validate HTTPS performance impact and ensure system can handle encrypted traffic load.
- Update load testing scripts in **test/performance/** to use HTTPS endpoints
- Add SSL handshake performance benchmarks in **test/benchmarks/ssl_performance.rb**
- Create HTTPS-specific stress tests to validate certificate handling under load
- Implement connection pooling tests for HTTPS connections
- Add monitoring for SSL/TLS performance metrics in **test/monitoring/https_metrics_test.rb**

### Step 4: Deployment and Rollback Strategy
Execute phased deployment with rollback capabilities and monitoring.

#### 4.1: Staging Environment Deployment
Deploy HTTPS configuration to staging environment for comprehensive testing.
- Deploy SSL certificates to staging servers and configure HTTPS listeners
- Update staging environment configuration files with HTTPS settings
- Execute full test suite against staging environment with HTTPS enabled
- Perform manual testing of all critical user flows over HTTPS
- Validate third-party integrations and webhook callbacks work with HTTPS

#### 4.2: Production Deployment with Blue-Green Strategy
Execute production deployment using blue-green deployment strategy for zero-downtime migration.
- Prepare green environment with HTTPS configuration and SSL certificates
- Update DNS records to gradually shift traffic from blue (HTTP) to green (HTTPS)
- Monitor application performance, error rates, and SSL certificate validity
- Implement automatic rollback triggers based on error rate thresholds
- Complete traffic migration and decommission blue environment after validation period

#### 4.3: Post-Deployment Monitoring and Optimization
Implement comprehensive monitoring and optimization for HTTPS performance.
- Set up SSL certificate expiration alerts in **monitoring/ssl_monitoring.rb**
- Configure HTTPS performance dashboards with SSL handshake metrics
- Implement automated certificate renewal verification in **scripts/cert_health_check.sh**
- Add security scanning automation to detect mixed content issues
- Create runbook documentation for HTTPS troubleshooting in **docs/https_troubleshooting.md**
