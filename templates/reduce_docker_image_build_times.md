# Reduce Docker image build times
Optimize Docker build performance through layer caching, multi-stage builds, and build context improvements.

## Summary of changes
- Current Docker builds are inefficient with poor layer caching and large build contexts
- Implement multi-stage builds to reduce final image size and improve caching
- Optimize Dockerfile layer ordering and add .dockerignore to reduce build context
- Add build caching strategies and parallel build optimizations
- Establish build time monitoring and benchmarking framework

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Analysis and Baseline
Establish current build performance metrics and identify optimization opportunities.

#### 1.1: Docker Build Performance Audit
Create comprehensive analysis of current Docker build performance and bottlenecks.
- Create **docs/docker-build-optimization.md** document with current build times for all images
- Document current Dockerfile structures and identify inefficient patterns
- Analyze build context sizes and identify unnecessary files being copied
- Record baseline metrics including build times, image sizes, and layer counts
- Identify images that would benefit most from optimization (longest build times)

#### 1.2: Build Context Analysis
Analyze and document what files are being included in Docker build contexts.
- Run `docker build --no-cache .` with timing for each service to establish baselines
- Use `docker history <image>` to analyze layer sizes for existing images
- Document findings in **docs/docker-build-optimization.md** with specific recommendations
- Create build time tracking script in **scripts/measure-build-times.sh**

### Step 2: Build Context Optimization
Reduce build context size to minimize data transfer to Docker daemon.

#### 2.1: Implement .dockerignore Files
Add comprehensive .dockerignore files to reduce build context size.
- Create or update **.dockerignore** files for each service directory
- Exclude common unnecessary files: `node_modules`, `.git`, `*.log`, `*.tmp`, test files
- Exclude development-only files and directories specific to each service
- Add IDE-specific files and OS-specific files to exclusion list
- Verify reduced build context size using `docker build --dry-run` equivalent commands

#### 2.2: Optimize File Copy Operations
Restructure Dockerfiles to minimize file copying and improve layer caching.
- Move dependency installation before application code copying in all Dockerfiles
- Separate package files (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.) copying from source code
- Use specific COPY commands instead of copying entire directories when possible
- Implement `.dockerignore` patterns to exclude test files and documentation from production builds

### Step 3: Multi-stage Build Implementation
Implement multi-stage builds to separate build dependencies from runtime requirements.

#### 3.1: Convert to Multi-stage Builds
Refactor existing Dockerfiles to use multi-stage build patterns.
- Identify services that can benefit from multi-stage builds (those with build tools/dependencies)
- Create build stage with all development dependencies and build tools
- Create production stage with only runtime dependencies and built artifacts
- Update **Dockerfile** for each applicable service with multi-stage structure
- Ensure final stage uses minimal base images (alpine, distroless) where appropriate

#### 3.2: Optimize Build Stages
Fine-tune multi-stage builds for maximum efficiency and caching.
- Order build stages to maximize Docker layer caching effectiveness
- Use build arguments to conditionally include development tools
- Implement parallel build stages where dependencies allow
- Add health checks and proper signal handling in final stage
- Update any build scripts in **scripts/** directory to work with new multi-stage approach

### Step 4: Layer Caching Optimization
Optimize Dockerfile layer structure for maximum cache hit rates.

#### 4.1: Reorder Dockerfile Instructions
Restructure Dockerfiles to optimize layer caching by placing frequently changing instructions last.
- Move package installation and system updates to early layers
- Place application dependency installation before source code copying
- Put source code copying and application-specific builds in later layers
- Ensure each RUN instruction is optimized for caching (combine related commands)
- Update all service Dockerfiles with optimized instruction ordering

#### 4.2: Implement Build Cache Strategies
Add build cache configuration and optimization techniques.
- Configure BuildKit for improved caching: add `# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1` to all Dockerfiles
- Implement cache mount points for package managers (npm, pip, apt) using `--mount=type=cache`
- Add build arguments for cache-busting when needed: `ARG CACHE_BUST`
- Create **docker-compose.build.yml** with optimized build configurations
- Update CI/CD pipeline configuration to use build cache effectively

### Step 5: Build Performance Monitoring
Implement monitoring and alerting for Docker build performance.

#### 5.1: Build Metrics Collection
Create automated build time tracking and reporting system.
- Enhance **scripts/measure-build-times.sh** to output structured data (JSON/CSV)
- Add build time measurement to CI/CD pipeline with performance thresholds
- Create build performance dashboard configuration in **monitoring/build-metrics.yml**
- Implement build time regression detection in CI pipeline
- Add build cache hit rate monitoring and reporting

#### 5.2: Performance Benchmarking Framework
Establish ongoing performance monitoring and optimization framework.
- Create **scripts/benchmark-builds.sh** for consistent performance testing
- Add build performance tests to automated test suite
- Create performance regression alerts for build time increases > 20%
- Document build optimization best practices in **docs/docker-build-best-practices.md**
- Set up weekly build performance reports and optimization reviews

### Step 6: Advanced Optimizations
Implement advanced Docker build optimizations and experimental features.

#### 6.1: Parallel Build Implementation
Configure parallel builds and build optimization features.
- Enable BuildKit experimental features for parallel builds where applicable
- Implement build dependency graphs for optimal parallel execution
- Configure Docker buildx for multi-platform builds with caching
- Update **Makefile** or build scripts to use parallel build capabilities
- Add build concurrency limits to prevent resource exhaustion

#### 6.2: Registry and Distribution Optimization
Optimize image distribution and registry interaction for faster builds.
- Configure Docker registry mirrors for faster base image pulls
- Implement image layer sharing strategies across related services
- Add registry caching configuration for CI/CD environments
- Configure image compression and distribution optimization
- Update deployment scripts to use optimized image pull strategies

## Manual testing plan
- Build each service from scratch and measure build times using **scripts/measure-build-times.sh**
- Verify build cache effectiveness by running builds twice and comparing times (second build should be significantly faster)
- Test multi-stage builds produce identical runtime behavior compared to original images
- Validate .dockerignore effectiveness by checking build context size before and after changes
- Perform end-to-end application testing to ensure optimized images maintain full functionality
- Test build performance under different scenarios: clean builds, cached builds, and partial cache invalidation
- Verify CI/CD pipeline integration works correctly with new build optimizations
- Test parallel build execution doesn't cause resource contention or build failures
