# Migrate React 16 to React 18
Upgrade React from version 16 to 18 with new features like concurrent rendering, automatic batching, and Suspense improvements while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Summary of changes
- Current React 16 application uses legacy ReactDOM.render() API and class-based lifecycle methods
- Upgrade to React 18 introduces breaking changes in rendering API, StrictMode behavior, and automatic batching
- Migration requires updating dependencies, replacing render APIs, addressing deprecated features, and adopting new concurrent features
- All existing functionality must remain intact while enabling new React 18 capabilities

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Dependency Analysis and Preparation
Analyze current React usage and prepare the codebase for migration.

#### 1.1: Audit Current React Usage
Create a comprehensive audit of React 16 usage patterns and potential breaking changes.
- Scan codebase for usage of `ReactDOM.render()`, `ReactDOM.hydrate()`, and `ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode()`
- Identify all class components using deprecated lifecycle methods (`componentWillMount`, `componentWillReceiveProps`, `componentWillUpdate`)
- Document usage of third-party libraries and their React 18 compatibility status
- Create **migration-audit.md** in project root with findings and compatibility matrix

#### 1.2: Update Package Dependencies
Update React and related packages to version 18 while maintaining build compatibility.
- Update **package.json** to use `"react": "^18.0.0"` and `"react-dom": "^18.0.0"`
- Update React-related dependencies (`@types/react`, `@types/react-dom`, `react-scripts`, etc.) to compatible versions
- Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to update lock files
- Verify build still compiles without errors using existing render API

#### 1.3: Update TypeScript Definitions
Update TypeScript types and configurations for React 18 compatibility.
- Update **tsconfig.json** to include React 18 JSX transform if using TypeScript 4.1+
- Add `"jsx": "react-jsx"` to compiler options if not already present
- Update any custom type definitions that reference React internal types
- Fix any TypeScript compilation errors related to updated React types

### Step 2: Core Rendering API Migration
Replace legacy rendering APIs with new React 18 createRoot API.

#### 2.1: Replace ReactDOM.render with createRoot
Update all application entry points to use the new createRoot API.
- Locate main application entry point (typically **src/index.js** or **src/index.tsx**)
- Replace `ReactDOM.render(element, container)` with `ReactDOM.createRoot(container).render(element)`
- Import `createRoot` from `react-dom/client` instead of using `ReactDOM.render`
- Update any test files using `ReactDOM.render` for component testing

#### 2.2: Replace ReactDOM.hydrate with hydrateRoot
Update server-side rendering hydration to use new hydrateRoot API.
- Replace `ReactDOM.hydrate(element, container)` with `ReactDOM.hydrateRoot(container, element)`
- Import `hydrateRoot` from `react-dom/client`
- Update any SSR-related configuration files
- Verify hydration warnings are properly handled in development mode

#### 2.3: Update Unmounting Logic
Replace unmountComponentAtNode with new root-based unmounting.
- Replace `ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode(container)` with `root.unmount()` where `root` is the created root
- Store root references where unmounting is needed (modals, dynamic components)
- Update cleanup logic in useEffect hooks and component lifecycle methods
- Test unmounting behavior in development and production builds

### Step 3: StrictMode and Development Experience Updates
Address React 18 StrictMode changes and development experience improvements.

#### 3.1: Update StrictMode Behavior
Adapt to React 18 StrictMode's enhanced development checks.
- Review and update components that may be affected by double-invocation of effects and state updaters
- Ensure useEffect cleanup functions properly handle being called multiple times
- Test components wrapped in StrictMode for proper behavior
- Update any development-only code that assumes single effect execution

#### 3.2: Address Automatic Batching Changes
Verify application behavior with React 18's automatic batching of state updates.
- Test components that rely on synchronous state updates in event handlers
- Update any code that depends on multiple setState calls triggering multiple renders
- Use `flushSync` from `react-dom` for cases requiring synchronous updates
- Verify async operations (promises, timeouts) now batch state updates automatically

#### 3.3: Update Development Tools Integration
Ensure development tools work properly with React 18.
- Update React DevTools browser extension to latest version
- Verify hot reloading and fast refresh work correctly with new rendering API
- Test error boundaries and error reporting in development mode
- Update any custom development utilities that interact with React internals

### Step 4: Feature Adoption and Optimization
Implement React 18 specific features and optimizations.

#### 4.1: Implement Concurrent Features
Adopt React 18 concurrent rendering features where beneficial.
- Identify components that would benefit from `useDeferredValue` for expensive computations
- Implement `useTransition` for non-urgent state updates (search, filtering, navigation)
- Wrap heavy computational components with `startTransition` for better user experience
- Test concurrent features in development and production environments

#### 4.2: Enhance Suspense Implementation
Improve existing Suspense usage with React 18 enhancements.
- Update Suspense boundaries to handle new concurrent rendering behavior
- Implement `useDeferredValue` with Suspense for better loading states
- Test Suspense behavior with concurrent features enabled
- Update error boundaries to work properly with Suspense and concurrent rendering

#### 4.3: Optimize Performance with New APIs
Leverage React 18 performance improvements and new optimization APIs.
- Review and optimize components using `useMemo` and `useCallback` with automatic batching
- Implement `useId` for generating stable IDs in SSR environments
- Update any custom hooks to work efficiently with concurrent rendering
- Profile application performance before and after migration

### Step 5: Testing and Validation
Comprehensive testing of the migrated application.

#### 5.1: Update Test Configuration
Ensure testing framework compatibility with React 18.
- Update **jest.config.js** or test configuration for React 18 compatibility
- Update React Testing Library to version compatible with React 18
- Configure test environment to use new rendering APIs
- Update any custom test utilities that use ReactDOM.render

#### 5.2: Update Unit and Integration Tests
Modify existing tests to work with React 18 changes.
- Replace `ReactDOM.render` with `createRoot().render()` in test files
- Update tests that rely on synchronous state updates to handle automatic batching
- Add tests for new React 18 features implemented in the application
- Ensure all existing test suites pass with React 18

#### 5.3: End-to-End Testing Validation
Verify complete application functionality with React 18.
- Run full end-to-end test suite to ensure no regressions
- Test application in both development and production builds
- Verify SSR functionality if applicable
- Test performance characteristics and loading behavior

## Manual testing plan
- **Application Startup**: Verify application loads correctly in development and production modes without console errors
- **User Interactions**: Test all major user flows including form submissions, navigation, and dynamic content loading
- **Performance Validation**: Compare application performance metrics before and after migration using browser dev tools
- **Browser Compatibility**: Test application across different browsers and versions to ensure React 18 compatibility
- **Development Experience**: Verify hot reloading, error boundaries, and development tools work correctly
- **Concurrent Features**: Test any implemented concurrent features (transitions, deferred values) for improved user experience
- **SSR Functionality**: If applicable, verify server-side rendering and hydration work correctly with new APIs
