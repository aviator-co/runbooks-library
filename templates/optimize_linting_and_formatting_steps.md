# Optimize Linting and Formatting Steps
Streamline and improve the performance of code linting and formatting processes across the development workflow.

## Summary of changes
- Current linting and formatting tools may have redundant configurations, slow execution times, or inconsistent rules
- Consolidate linting configurations, optimize tool performance, and establish consistent formatting standards
- Implement incremental linting, parallel execution, and caching strategies to reduce CI/CD pipeline time
- Standardize pre-commit hooks and IDE integration for better developer experience

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Analysis and Audit
Assess current linting and formatting setup to identify optimization opportunities.

#### 1.1: Audit Current Linting Configuration
Analyze existing linting tools, configurations, and performance bottlenecks across the codebase.
- Create **audit-report.md** documenting all current linting tools (ESLint, Pylint, etc.) and their configurations
- Measure and record current linting execution times for different parts of the codebase
- Identify overlapping or conflicting rules between different linting tools
- Document current formatting tools (Prettier, Black, etc.) and their configurations
- Analyze CI/CD pipeline logs to identify linting-related bottlenecks

#### 1.2: Research Optimization Strategies
Investigate modern linting and formatting optimization techniques and tools.
- Research incremental linting strategies and tools that support changed-files-only execution
- Evaluate caching solutions for linting results (lint-staged, nx cache, etc.)
- Investigate parallel execution options for multi-language codebases
- Document findings in **optimization-strategies.md** with recommended approaches
- Benchmark performance improvements from similar optimization efforts in open source projects

### Step 2: Configuration Consolidation
Streamline and optimize linting and formatting configurations.

#### 2.1: Consolidate ESLint Configuration
Merge and optimize JavaScript/TypeScript linting configurations for consistency and performance.
- Create unified **.eslintrc.js** or **eslint.config.js** file replacing multiple configuration files
- Remove duplicate or conflicting rules across different ESLint configuration files
- Optimize rule selection by disabling expensive rules that provide minimal value
- Configure ESLint to use **--cache** flag and specify cache location in **.eslintcache**
- Update **package.json** scripts to use optimized ESLint commands with caching

#### 2.2: Optimize Language-Specific Linters
Streamline configurations for other language linters (Python, Go, etc.) if applicable.
- Consolidate Python linting configuration in **pyproject.toml** or **.flake8** files
- Configure **pylint** and **flake8** to use parallel execution with **--jobs** parameter
- Optimize Go linting by configuring **golangci-lint** with appropriate timeout and parallel settings
- Update linting configurations to exclude unnecessary files and directories
- Implement consistent ignore patterns across all linting tools in respective ignore files

#### 2.3: Standardize Formatting Configuration
Establish consistent formatting rules and optimize formatter performance.
- Create unified **prettier.config.js** or **.prettierrc** configuration file
- Configure **Black** formatting for Python with consistent line length and formatting rules
- Set up **gofmt** or **goimports** configuration for Go files if applicable
- Create **.editorconfig** file to ensure consistent formatting across different editors
- Update all formatting tool configurations to use consistent indentation, line endings, and max line length

### Step 3: Performance Optimization
Implement caching, incremental processing, and parallel execution strategies.

#### 3.1: Implement Incremental Linting
Configure linting tools to process only changed files for faster execution.
- Install and configure **lint-staged** package for pre-commit incremental linting
- Update **package.json** to include lint-staged configuration targeting specific file patterns
- Configure CI/CD pipeline to use git diff for identifying changed files in pull requests
- Create shell scripts in **scripts/** directory for incremental linting in different scenarios
- Update **husky** pre-commit hooks to use lint-staged instead of full codebase linting

#### 3.2: Enable Caching and Parallel Execution
Configure linting tools to use caching and parallel processing for improved performance.
- Configure ESLint to use **--cache-location .eslintcache** and add cache files to **.gitignore**
- Set up **ESLINT_USE_FLAT_CONFIG=true** environment variable if using flat config
- Configure parallel execution for multi-core systems using **--max-warnings 0 --ext .js,.ts,.jsx,.tsx**
- Enable **pylint** parallel execution with **--jobs=0** to use all available CPU cores
- Configure **golangci-lint** with **--timeout=5m** and **--concurrency=4** for optimal performance

#### 3.3: Optimize CI/CD Pipeline Integration
Update continuous integration workflows to use optimized linting strategies.
- Update **.github/workflows/lint.yml** or equivalent CI configuration to use caching
- Configure CI to restore and save linting cache between runs using actions/cache
- Implement matrix builds for parallel linting of different file types or directories
- Add conditional linting that skips unchanged files using git diff in CI environment
- Configure CI to fail fast on linting errors while allowing formatting fixes to be suggested

### Step 4: Developer Experience Enhancement
Improve local development workflow and IDE integration.

#### 4.1: Setup Pre-commit Hooks
Configure automated pre-commit hooks for consistent code quality.
- Install and configure **husky** for Git hook management if not already present
- Create **.husky/pre-commit** hook that runs lint-staged for incremental checking
- Configure **pre-commit** hook to run formatting tools automatically before commit
- Add **prepare** script in **package.json** to install husky hooks automatically
- Create documentation in **CONTRIBUTING.md** explaining the pre-commit workflow

#### 4.2: IDE Integration Configuration
Provide standardized IDE configurations for consistent development experience.
- Create **.vscode/settings.json** with ESLint, Prettier, and other linting tool configurations
- Configure auto-fix on save for supported linting and formatting tools
- Create **.vscode/extensions.json** recommending essential linting and formatting extensions
- Provide **IntelliJ IDEA** configuration files in **.idea/** directory for consistent setup
- Document IDE setup instructions in **docs/development-setup.md**

#### 4.3: Performance Monitoring and Reporting
Implement monitoring to track linting performance improvements.
- Create **scripts/lint-performance.js** script to measure and report linting execution times
- Add performance metrics collection to CI/CD pipeline for tracking improvements
- Configure linting tools to output timing information and warnings count
- Create dashboard or reporting mechanism to track linting performance over time
- Document performance benchmarks in **performance-metrics.md** for future reference

## Manual testing plan
- Run linting commands locally and verify execution time improvements compared to baseline measurements
- Test pre-commit hooks by making code changes and ensuring only changed files are processed
- Verify CI/CD pipeline runs faster with caching enabled by comparing build times before and after changes
- Test IDE integration by opening project in VS Code/IntelliJ and verifying auto-fix and formatting works correctly
- Validate that all existing linting rules still catch the same issues after optimization
- Confirm that formatting output remains consistent across different environments and tools
- Test incremental linting by modifying files in different directories and ensuring appropriate linting scope
