# Add Skeleton Loading Screens
Implement skeleton loading screens across the application to improve perceived performance and user experience during data loading states.

## Summary of changes
- Currently the application shows blank screens or basic spinners during loading states
- Add a comprehensive skeleton loading system with reusable components
- Implement skeleton screens for major UI sections including lists, cards, forms, and detail views
- Integrate skeleton loading states into existing data fetching flows
- Ensure consistent visual design and smooth transitions between loading and loaded states

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Foundation Setup
Establish the core skeleton loading infrastructure and design system components.

#### 1.1: Create Base Skeleton Components
Create foundational skeleton components that can be composed into larger loading states.
- Create **src/components/skeleton/SkeletonBase.tsx** with basic skeleton rectangle component
- Add CSS animations for shimmer effect in **src/components/skeleton/skeleton.css**
- Create **SkeletonText.tsx** component for text line placeholders with configurable width
- Create **SkeletonCircle.tsx** component for avatar and icon placeholders
- Create **SkeletonImage.tsx** component for image placeholders with aspect ratio support
- Add TypeScript interfaces in **src/components/skeleton/types.ts** for skeleton props
- Export all skeleton components from **src/components/skeleton/index.ts**

#### 1.2: Design System Integration
Integrate skeleton components with the existing design system and theming.
- Add skeleton color variables to **src/styles/variables.css** or theme configuration
- Ensure skeleton components respect dark/light theme modes
- Add skeleton component documentation to **src/components/skeleton/README.md**
- Create Storybook stories in **src/components/skeleton/Skeleton.stories.tsx** for all skeleton variants
- Add unit tests for skeleton components in **src/components/skeleton/__tests__/Skeleton.test.tsx**

#### 1.3: Composite Skeleton Templates
Build higher-level skeleton templates for common UI patterns.
- Create **SkeletonCard.tsx** for card-based layouts with image, title, and description areas
- Create **SkeletonListItem.tsx** for list row layouts with avatar, text, and action areas
- Create **SkeletonForm.tsx** for form layouts with input field and label placeholders
- Create **SkeletonTable.tsx** for table layouts with header and row placeholders
- Add configuration props for customizing template layouts and dimensions
- Test all composite templates with unit tests and visual regression tests

### Step 2: Core Integration
Integrate skeleton loading into the application's data fetching and state management systems.

#### 2.1: Loading State Management
Enhance existing loading state management to support skeleton loading patterns.
- Update **src/hooks/useApi.ts** or similar data fetching hooks to include skeleton loading states
- Add `isSkeletonLoading` boolean to loading state interfaces in **src/types/api.ts**
- Modify loading state reducers to handle skeleton-specific loading phases
- Create **useSkeletonDelay.ts** hook to prevent skeleton flashing on fast network responses
- Add skeleton loading state to React Query or SWR configurations if applicable
- Update existing loading state tests to cover skeleton loading scenarios

#### 2.2: Route-Level Loading Integration
Implement skeleton loading at the route and page level for major application sections.
- Update **src/pages/Dashboard.tsx** to show skeleton loading during initial data fetch
- Add skeleton loading to **src/pages/UserProfile.tsx** for profile data and settings
- Implement skeleton loading in **src/pages/ProductList.tsx** for product catalog loading
- Add skeleton loading to **src/pages/ProductDetail.tsx** for individual product pages
- Update navigation components to show skeleton states during route transitions
- Ensure skeleton loading respects user preferences and accessibility settings

### Step 3: Component-Level Implementation
Apply skeleton loading to individual components and UI sections throughout the application.

#### 3.1: List and Grid Components
Implement skeleton loading for list-based and grid-based UI components.
- Update **src/components/ProductGrid.tsx** to show skeleton cards during loading
- Add skeleton loading to **src/components/UserList.tsx** with skeleton list items
- Implement skeleton loading in **src/components/SearchResults.tsx** for search states
- Add skeleton loading to **src/components/ActivityFeed.tsx** for activity streams
- Update infinite scroll components to show skeleton loading for new page loads
- Ensure skeleton loading maintains proper grid layouts and responsive behavior

#### 3.2: Detail and Form Components
Add skeleton loading to detailed views and form components.
- Implement skeleton loading in **src/components/UserProfileCard.tsx** for user details
- Add skeleton loading to **src/components/ProductDetails.tsx** for product information
- Update **src/components/SettingsForm.tsx** to show skeleton loading during form initialization
- Add skeleton loading to **src/components/CommentSection.tsx** for comment threads
- Implement skeleton loading in modal dialogs and drawer components
- Ensure form skeleton loading preserves layout structure and field groupings

#### 3.3: Navigation and Header Components
Apply skeleton loading to navigation elements and header sections.
- Update **src/components/Header.tsx** to show skeleton loading for user menu and notifications
- Add skeleton loading to **src/components/Sidebar.tsx** for navigation menu items
- Implement skeleton loading in **src/components/Breadcrumbs.tsx** for navigation paths
- Add skeleton loading to **src/components/TabNavigation.tsx** for tab content loading
- Update search bar components to show skeleton suggestions during search
- Ensure navigation skeleton loading doesn't interfere with accessibility navigation

### Step 4: Advanced Features and Optimization
Implement advanced skeleton loading features and performance optimizations.

#### 4.1: Smart Loading Patterns
Implement intelligent skeleton loading patterns based on user behavior and content types.
- Create **src/utils/skeletonPreloader.ts** for predictive skeleton loading
- Add skeleton loading duration optimization based on typical API response times
- Implement progressive skeleton loading that reveals content as it becomes available
- Add skeleton loading priority system for above-the-fold content
- Create skeleton loading analytics to track loading performance metrics
- Add A/B testing framework for different skeleton loading strategies

#### 4.2: Accessibility and Performance
Ensure skeleton loading meets accessibility standards and performance requirements.
- Add ARIA labels and screen reader support to skeleton components
- Implement **prefers-reduced-motion** CSS media query support for skeleton animations
- Add skeleton loading performance monitoring and metrics collection
- Optimize skeleton CSS animations for 60fps performance on low-end devices
- Add skeleton loading memory usage optimization for large lists
- Create performance tests for skeleton loading in **src/tests/performance/skeleton.test.ts**

## Manual testing plan
- Navigate through all major application routes and verify skeleton loading appears during initial page loads
- Test skeleton loading behavior on slow network connections using browser developer tools
- Verify skeleton loading maintains proper layout structure and doesn't cause content jumping
- Test skeleton loading with screen readers to ensure accessibility compliance
- Validate skeleton loading animations respect user motion preferences
- Test skeleton loading on various device sizes and orientations for responsive behavior
- Verify skeleton loading integrates properly with existing error handling and retry mechanisms
- Test skeleton loading performance on low-end devices and older browsers
- Validate that skeleton loading transitions smoothly to actual content without visual glitches
- Test skeleton loading behavior during rapid navigation and route changes
