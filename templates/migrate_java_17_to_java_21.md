# Java 17 to Java 21 Migration Runbook
Migrate the codebase from Java 17 to Java 21 to leverage performance improvements, new language features, and maintain long-term support.

## Summary of changes
- Current codebase is running on Java 17 which will lose extended support in 2029
- Java 21 is the next LTS version with support until 2031 and offers significant performance improvements
- Migration involves updating build configurations, dependencies, CI/CD pipelines, and addressing any compatibility issues
- New language features like pattern matching enhancements, virtual threads, and record patterns can be leveraged
- Docker images, deployment configurations, and documentation need updates

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Pre-Migration Analysis and Planning
Comprehensive assessment of current Java 17 usage and potential Java 21 compatibility issues.

#### 1.1: Dependency Compatibility Audit
Create a comprehensive audit of all dependencies and their Java 21 compatibility status.
- Scan **pom.xml** or **build.gradle** files to extract all direct and transitive dependencies
- Research each dependency's Java 21 compatibility on their official documentation or GitHub releases
- Create **docs/java21-migration/dependency-audit.md** documenting findings with version recommendations
- Identify dependencies that need version upgrades or replacements for Java 21 compatibility
- Document any dependencies that may cause blocking issues

#### 1.2: Code Analysis for Breaking Changes
Analyze existing codebase for potential Java 21 breaking changes and deprecated API usage.
- Run static analysis tools to identify usage of deprecated APIs that were removed in Java 21
- Search codebase for usage of **sun.*** packages or other internal APIs that may have changed
- Document findings in **docs/java21-migration/code-analysis.md** with specific file locations and recommended fixes
- Identify usage of reflection, serialization, or JNI that might be affected by module system changes
- Check for any custom security managers or policy files that need updates

#### 1.3: Infrastructure and Tooling Assessment
Evaluate development and deployment infrastructure readiness for Java 21.
- Audit IDE configurations, build servers, and developer machine Java versions
- Check CI/CD pipeline configurations for Java version specifications
- Review Docker base images and container configurations
- Document current infrastructure state in **docs/java21-migration/infrastructure-audit.md**
- Create migration timeline and rollback procedures

- Configure build to use Java 21 toolchain while maintaining backward compatibility
- Update any custom Maven plugins or Gradle plugins to Java 21 compatible versions

#### 2.2: Core Dependency Version Updates
Upgrade critical dependencies to Java 21 compatible versions.
- Update Spring Framework/Spring Boot to latest version supporting Java 21
- Upgrade testing frameworks (JUnit, Mockito, TestContainers) to Java 21 compatible versions
- Update logging frameworks (Logback, SLF4J) to versions supporting Java 21
- Upgrade database drivers and connection pools to Java 21 compatible versions
- Update **pom.xml** or **build.gradle** with new dependency versions and test build compatibility

#### 2.3: Secondary Dependency Updates
Update remaining dependencies and plugins to Java 21 compatible versions.
- Upgrade utility libraries (Apache Commons, Guava, Jackson) to Java 21 compatible versions
- Update build and code quality plugins (SpotBugs, Checkstyle, PMD) to support Java 21
- Upgrade any custom or third-party libraries to Java 21 compatible versions
- Update documentation generation tools (JavaDoc plugins) for Java 21 compatibility
- Verify all dependency updates don't introduce breaking changes through comprehensive testing

### Step 3: CI/CD Pipeline Migration
Update continuous integration and deployment pipelines to use Java 21.

#### 3.1: CI Pipeline Configuration Updates
Update build pipeline configurations to use Java 21 for compilation and testing.
- Update **Jenkinsfile**, **.github/workflows/**, or other CI configuration files to use Java 21
- Configure pipeline to run tests on both Java 17 and Java 21 during transition period
- Update Docker build agents or runner configurations to include Java 21
- Modify pipeline scripts to use Java 21 specific JVM arguments and optimizations
- Add pipeline stage to verify Java 21 compatibility before deployment

#### 3.2: Docker Image Updates
Update container configurations and base images to use Java 21.
- Update **Dockerfile** to use Java 21 base images (eclipse-temurin:21-jre or similar)
- Modify container startup scripts to use Java 21 specific JVM tuning parameters
- Update **docker-compose.yml** files to reference new Java 21 images
- Test container builds and runtime behavior with Java 21
- Update any Kubernetes deployment manifests to reference new Java 21 images

#### 3.3: Deployment Configuration Updates
Update deployment and runtime configurations for Java 21 compatibility.
- Update application server configurations (Tomcat, Jetty) to Java 21 compatible versions
- Modify JVM startup parameters in deployment scripts for Java 21 optimizations
- Update monitoring and profiling tool configurations for Java 21 compatibility
- Modify any environment-specific configuration files for Java 21
- Update deployment documentation with Java 21 specific instructions

### Step 4: Code Migration and Feature Adoption
Migrate code to Java 21 and optionally adopt new language features.

#### 4.1: Fix Compatibility Issues
Address any code compatibility issues identified during analysis phase.
- Fix deprecated API usage by replacing with Java 21 recommended alternatives
- Update any reflection or serialization code that may be affected by module system changes
- Resolve any compilation errors or warnings introduced by Java 21

- Confirm all integrations (databases, external APIs, message queues) work correctly with Java 21
- Test application behavior under load to verify stability and performance improvements
- Verify monitoring, logging, and observability tools correctly capture Java 21 runtime metrics
- Validate backup and restore procedures work correctly with Java 21 runtime
- Test deployment and rollback procedures in staging environment before production deployment
