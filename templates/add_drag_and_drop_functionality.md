# Add Drag and Drop Functionality
Implement comprehensive drag and drop capabilities across the application with proper visual feedback, accessibility support, and cross-browser compatibility.

## Summary of changes
- Current application lacks any drag and drop functionality for user interface elements
- Need to implement a reusable drag and drop system that can handle multiple content types (text, images, files, UI components)
- Changes will include core drag and drop utilities, visual feedback components, accessibility features, and integration points
- Implementation will follow progressive enhancement principles to ensure graceful degradation

### Step 3: File Upload Integration
Integrate drag and drop functionality with file upload capabilities.

#### 3.1: Create File Drop Handler
Implement specialized handling for file drag and drop operations.
- Create **src/components/FileDropZone/FileDropZone.jsx** component
- Implement file validation (type, size, count restrictions)
- Add support for directory uploads where browser supports it
- Include progress indicators and error handling for large files
- Create comprehensive tests including file mock scenarios

#### 3.2: Integrate with Existing Upload System
Connect file drop functionality with the current file upload infrastructure.
- Modify existing upload components to accept dropped files
- Update **src/services/uploadService.js** to handle drag-dropped files
- Ensure consistent error handling and progress reporting
- Add batch upload support for multiple dropped files
- Update existing upload tests to cover drag and drop scenarios

#### 3.3: Add File Preview and Management
Implement preview functionality for dropped files before upload.
- Create **src/components/FilePreview/FilePreview.jsx** for dropped file previews
- Add thumbnail generation for image files
- Implement file removal and reordering capabilities
- Include metadata display (size, type, last modified)
- Add accessibility features for keyboard navigation

### Step 4: UI Component Drag and Drop
Enable drag and drop for reordering and organizing UI elements.

#### 4.1: Create Sortable List Component
Implement drag and drop reordering for list items.
- Create **src/components/SortableList/SortableList.jsx** component
- Implement smooth animations for item reordering
- Add support for nested lists and multi-level sorting
- Include touch device support for mobile drag and drop
- Create comprehensive test suite for sorting scenarios

#### 4.2: Implement Draggable Card System
Create draggable card components for dashboard and layout management.
- Create **src/components/DraggableCard/DraggableCard.jsx** component
- Implement grid-based positioning and snap-to-grid functionality
- Add resize handles and boundary constraints
- Include collision detection and auto-positioning
