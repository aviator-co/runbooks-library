# Migrate jQuery UI to modern React components
Replace legacy jQuery UI components with modern React equivalents to improve maintainability, performance, and developer experience.

## Summary of changes
- Audit existing jQuery UI usage across the codebase to identify all components and dependencies
- Create modern React component replacements for jQuery UI widgets (dialogs, datepickers, autocomplete, etc.)
- Implement a phased migration strategy to replace components incrementally without breaking functionality
- Update build system to remove jQuery UI dependencies and optimize bundle size
- Establish new component library standards and documentation for future development

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Analysis and Planning
Conduct comprehensive audit of current jQuery UI usage and create migration strategy.

#### 1.1: Audit jQuery UI Usage
Create a comprehensive inventory of all jQuery UI components currently in use across the application.
- Search codebase for jQuery UI imports, CDN references, and widget initializations using `grep -r "jquery-ui\|\.dialog\|\.datepicker\|\.autocomplete\|\.sortable\|\.draggable" src/`
- Document all jQuery UI components found in **audit-jquery-ui.md** including file locations, usage patterns, and dependencies
- Identify custom jQuery UI themes and styling overrides in CSS files
- Create component usage frequency analysis to prioritize migration order

#### 1.2: Create Migration Strategy Document
Develop detailed migration plan with component mapping and timeline.
- Create **migration-strategy.md** documenting React component alternatives for each jQuery UI widget
- Define migration phases based on component complexity and usage frequency
- Establish coding standards for new React components including TypeScript interfaces, prop naming conventions, and accessibility requirements
- Document breaking changes and compatibility considerations for each component migration

#### 1.3: Setup Development Environment
Prepare development environment with necessary React component libraries and tooling.
- Install React component libraries: `npm install @mui/material @mui/x-date-pickers react-beautiful-dnd`
- Add development dependencies: `npm install --save-dev @types/react @types/react-dom`
- Configure ESLint rules for React best practices in **.eslintrc.js**
- Setup Storybook for component development: `npx storybook@latest init`

### Step 2: Core Infrastructure Components
Create foundational React components that will be used across multiple features.

#### 3.1: Replace Dialog Components in User Management
Convert user management dialogs from jQuery UI to React Modal components.
- Update **src/pages/UserManagement/UserDialog.jsx** to use new Modal component instead of jQuery UI dialog
- Refactor form submission logic to use React state management and modern form handling
- Update **src/pages/UserManagement/UserDialog.test.jsx** to test React component behavior instead of jQuery interactions
- Verify user creation, editing, and deletion workflows function correctly with new modal implementation

#### 3.2: Replace DatePicker in Forms
Convert form date inputs from jQuery UI datepicker to React DatePicker component.
- Update **src/components/Forms/DateInput.jsx** to use new DatePicker component with consistent prop interface
- Migrate date validation logic from jQuery UI validation to React form validation
- Update **src/components/Forms/DateInput.test.jsx** to test React component date selection and validation
- Ensure all forms using DateInput component continue to function with proper date handling

#### 3.3: Replace Autocomplete in Search Features
Convert search autocomplete functionality from jQuery UI to React Autocomplete component.
- Update **src/components/Search/SearchBox.jsx** to use new Autocomplete component with API integration
- Refactor search result handling to use React state and modern async patterns
- Update **src/components/Search/SearchBox.test.jsx** to test React component search behavior and result selection
- Verify search functionality works across all pages using SearchBox component

### Step 4: User Interface Migration - Phase 2
Migrate complex jQuery UI components requiring more extensive refactoring.

#### 4.1: Replace Sortable Lists
Convert jQuery UI sortable functionality to React drag-and-drop components.
- Install and configure react-beautiful-dnd: `npm install react-beautiful-dnd @types/react-beautiful-dnd`
- Update **src/components/Lists/SortableList.jsx** to use react-beautiful-dnd instead of jQuery UI sortable
- Implement drag-and-drop state management and persistence logic using React hooks
- Update **src/components/Lists/SortableList.test.jsx** to test drag-and-drop functionality and state updates

#### 4.2: Replace Draggable Elements
Convert jQuery UI draggable widgets to React-based drag functionality.
- Update **src/components/Dashboard/DraggableWidget.jsx** to use react-beautiful-dnd for widget positioning
- Refactor widget layout persistence to use React state management instead of jQuery UI position tracking
- Update **src/components/Dashboard/DraggableWidget.test.jsx** to test React drag functionality and layout persistence
