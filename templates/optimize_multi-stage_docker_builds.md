- Create new multi-stage **api/Dockerfile** with separate build and runtime stages
- Use lightweight base image (alpine or distroless) for runtime stage
- Copy only necessary artifacts from build stage to runtime stage
- Update **api/.dockerignore** to exclude development files from build context
- Test build process and verify functionality with existing tests

#### 3.2: Optimize Database Migration Service
Implement multi-stage build for database migration service to reduce deployment image size.
- Convert **migrations/Dockerfile** to multi-stage build pattern
- Separate migration tools installation from runtime execution
- Use minimal base image for runtime stage with only required migration tools
- Update migration scripts to work with optimized container structure
- Test migration process in development environment

#### 3.3: Optimize Background Job Processors
Apply multi-stage optimization to background job processing services.
- Update **workers/Dockerfile** with multi-stage build separating build tools from runtime
- Optimize Python/Node.js dependency installation using build cache mounts
- Create separate stages for development dependencies vs production runtime
- Update worker startup scripts to work with optimized container structure
- Verify job processing functionality with integration tests

### Step 4: Frontend Services Optimization
Optimize frontend build processes using multi-stage builds to separate build tools from served content.

#### 4.1: Optimize Web Application Build
Implement multi-stage build for main web application with build-time and serve-time separation.
- Convert **web/Dockerfile** to multi-stage build with Node.js build stage and nginx serve stage
- Use `node:alpine` for build stage and `nginx:alpine` for runtime stage
- Copy built assets from build stage to nginx document root
- Update **web/nginx.conf** for optimized static file serving
- Test application functionality and asset loading

#### 4.2: Optimize Static Asset Pipeline
Create optimized build process for static assets and CDN preparation.
- Update **assets/Dockerfile** with multi-stage build for asset compilation
- Separate asset build tools from final asset distribution
- Implement asset minification and compression in build stage
- Create lightweight distribution image with only compiled assets
- Update asset deployment scripts to use new multi-stage build

### Step 5: CI/CD Pipeline Integration
Update continuous integration and deployment pipelines to leverage multi-stage build optimizations.

#### 5.1: Update CI Build Pipeline
Modify CI configuration to use multi-stage builds and implement build caching strategies.
- Update **.github/workflows/build.yml** (or equivalent CI config) to use BuildKit
- Implement Docker layer caching using `--cache-from` and `--cache-to` flags
- Add parallel builds for different stages where possible
- Configure build matrix for different target stages (development, testing, production)
- Add build time and image size reporting to CI output

#### 5.2: Update Deployment Pipeline
Enhance deployment pipeline to leverage optimized images and staging capabilities.
- Update **deploy/docker-compose.yml** to use multi-stage build targets
- Configure production deployment to use optimized runtime images
