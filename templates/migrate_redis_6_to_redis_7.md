# Migrate Redis 6 to Redis 7
Upgrade Redis from version 6 to version 7 with backward compatibility and zero downtime deployment strategy.

## Summary of changes
- Current Redis 6 deployment needs to be upgraded to Redis 7 for improved performance and security features
- Migration will be performed using a blue-green deployment strategy to ensure zero downtime
- Configuration files and client libraries will be updated to support Redis 7 features while maintaining backward compatibility
- Monitoring and alerting systems will be updated to track Redis 7 specific metrics

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Pre-Migration Analysis and Planning
Comprehensive analysis of current Redis usage and preparation for migration.

#### 1.1: Redis Usage Audit
Document current Redis 6 configuration, usage patterns, and dependencies to ensure smooth migration.
- Create **docs/redis-migration/current-state-audit.md** documenting Redis 6 configuration, memory usage, and key statistics
- Analyze Redis logs from the past 30 days to identify usage patterns and potential issues
- Document all applications and services that connect to Redis with their connection patterns
- Identify Redis modules, plugins, or custom configurations that may need updates

#### 1.2: Compatibility Assessment
Evaluate Redis 7 compatibility with existing codebase and infrastructure.
- Create **docs/redis-migration/compatibility-analysis.md** documenting Redis 7 breaking changes and their impact
- Review Redis client library versions across all applications and document upgrade requirements
- Analyze custom Redis scripts and commands for Redis 7 compatibility
- Document any deprecated features currently in use that need migration

#### 1.3: Migration Strategy Documentation
Define the complete migration approach and rollback procedures.
- Create **docs/redis-migration/migration-strategy.md** with detailed blue-green deployment plan
- Document rollback procedures and success criteria for each migration phase
- Define monitoring checkpoints and health checks for the migration process
- Create timeline and resource allocation plan for the migration

### Step 2: Infrastructure Preparation
Set up Redis 7 infrastructure and testing environments.

#### 2.1: Redis 7 Test Environment Setup
Establish isolated Redis 7 environment for testing and validation.
- Update **infrastructure/redis/docker-compose.yml** to include Redis 7 service alongside Redis 6
- Create **infrastructure/redis/redis7-test.conf** with Redis 7 configuration based on current Redis 6 settings
- Deploy Redis 7 test instance with data replication from Redis 6
- Verify Redis 7 instance is running and accessible through health checks

#### 2.2: Monitoring and Alerting Updates
Update monitoring systems to support Redis 7 metrics and alerts.
- Update **monitoring/redis-dashboard.json** to include Redis 7 specific metrics and panels
- Modify **alerting/redis-alerts.yml** to support both Redis 6 and Redis 7 during transition
- Add Redis 7 health checks to **monitoring/health-checks.yml**
- Test all monitoring and alerting configurations against Redis 7 test instance

### Step 3: Application Layer Updates
Update client libraries and application configurations for Redis 7 compatibility.

#### 3.1: Redis Client Library Upgrades
Update Redis client libraries across all applications to versions compatible with Redis 7.
- Update **package.json** or equivalent dependency files to use Redis 7 compatible client library versions
- Modify Redis connection configurations in **config/redis.js** or equivalent files to support Redis 7 connection parameters
- Update Redis client initialization code to handle Redis 7 authentication and connection pooling
- Run unit tests to verify client library compatibility with existing Redis operations

#### 3.2: Application Configuration Updates
Update application configurations to support Redis 7 features and connection parameters.
- Update **config/production.yml** and **config/staging.yml** with Redis 7 connection strings and parameters
- Modify environment variable templates in **.env.example** to include Redis 7 specific configurations
- Update application startup scripts in **scripts/start.sh** to include Redis 7 health check validations
- Add Redis 7 connection retry logic and error handling in application connection managers

#### 3.3: Database Migration Scripts
Create scripts to handle data migration and validation between Redis versions.
- Create **scripts/redis-migration/data-sync.sh** to synchronize data from Redis 6 to Redis 7
- Develop **scripts/redis-migration/validate-migration.py** to compare data integrity between Redis instances
- Create **scripts/redis-migration/rollback-data.sh** for emergency data rollback procedures
- Add **scripts/redis-migration/performance-benchmark.sh** to compare performance metrics between versions

### Step 4: Testing and Validation
Comprehensive testing of Redis 7 functionality and performance.

#### 4.1: Functional Testing
Validate all Redis operations work correctly with Redis 7.
- Update integration tests in **tests/integration/redis-tests.js** to run against both Redis 6 and Redis 7
- Create **tests/redis-migration/migration-tests.js** to validate data consistency during migration
- Run load tests using **tests/performance/redis-load-test.js** against Redis 7 to ensure performance parity
- Execute all existing test suites against Redis 7 environment to identify any compatibility issues

#### 4.2: Performance Validation
Ensure Redis 7 meets or exceeds current performance benchmarks.
- Run **scripts/redis-migration/performance-benchmark.sh** to compare Redis 6 vs Redis 7 performance
- Document performance results in **docs/redis-migration/performance-comparison.md**
- Validate memory usage patterns and optimization in Redis 7 configuration
- Test Redis 7 under peak load conditions to ensure stability and performance

### Step 5: Production Deployment
Execute the production migration using blue-green deployment strategy.

#### 5.1: Blue-Green Deployment Setup
Set up parallel Redis 7 production environment for seamless migration.
- Deploy Redis 7 production instance using **infrastructure/redis/redis7-prod.conf** configuration
- Configure data replication from Redis 6 to Redis 7 production instance
- Set up load balancer configuration in **infrastructure/loadbalancer/redis-lb.conf** to support traffic switching
- Validate Redis 7 production instance health and data synchronization status

#### 5.2: Traffic Migration
Gradually migrate application traffic from Redis 6 to Redis 7.
- Update **config/production.yml** to point to Redis 7 instance for canary deployment (10% traffic)
- Monitor application performance and Redis 7 metrics for 24 hours
- Gradually increase traffic to Redis 7 (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) with monitoring at each stage
- Update DNS and service discovery configurations to point to Redis 7 as primary instance

#### 5.3: Redis 6 Decommission
Safely decommission Redis 6 instance after successful migration.
- Stop data replication from Redis 6 to Redis 7 after confirming stable operation
- Create final backup of Redis 6 data in **backups/redis6-final-backup.rdb**
- Update **infrastructure/redis/docker-compose.yml** to remove Redis 6 service definition
- Remove Redis 6 monitoring and alerting configurations from monitoring systems

## Manual testing plan
- Verify Redis 7 instance responds to basic commands (SET, GET, DEL, EXISTS)
- Test Redis 7 performance using redis-benchmark tool and compare with Redis 6 baseline
- Validate all application features that use Redis caching work correctly
- Test Redis 7 persistence by restarting the instance and verifying data integrity
- Verify Redis 7 memory usage is within expected limits under normal load
- Test failover scenarios by simulating Redis 7 instance failures and recovery
- Validate monitoring dashboards display correct Redis 7 metrics and alerts trigger appropriately
- Test rollback procedure by reverting traffic to Redis 6 and ensuring no data loss
