# Webpack 4 to Webpack 5 Migration
Upgrade the project's build system from Webpack 4 to Webpack 5 with compatibility and performance improvements.

## Summary of changes
- Current project uses Webpack 4 which is no longer maintained and lacks modern features
- Webpack 5 introduces Module Federation, improved tree shaking, persistent caching, and better performance
- Migration requires updating dependencies, configuration files, and resolving breaking changes
- Plugin ecosystem needs updates for Webpack 5 compatibility
- Build scripts and CI/CD pipelines may need adjustments

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Pre-migration Analysis and Planning
Assess current Webpack configuration and identify potential compatibility issues before starting the migration.

#### 1.1: Audit Current Webpack Configuration
Document the existing Webpack setup to understand the scope of changes required.
- Create **`docs/webpack-migration-audit.md`** documenting current Webpack version, plugins, and loaders
- List all webpack-related dependencies in **`package.json`** with their current versions
- Document custom webpack configurations in **`webpack.config.js`** and any environment-specific configs
- Identify any custom plugins or loaders that may need updates
- Note any webpack-dev-server configurations and development workflows

#### 1.2: Research Webpack 5 Breaking Changes
Identify specific breaking changes that will affect the current codebase.
- Review Webpack 5 migration guide and document breaking changes relevant to the project
- Check compatibility of current plugins and loaders with Webpack 5
- Identify deprecated features currently in use (like `require.ensure`, Node.js polyfills)
- Document required changes for **`webpack.config.js`** structure and options
- Create migration checklist in **`docs/webpack-migration-audit.md`**

### Step 2: Dependency Updates
Update Webpack and related dependencies to their Webpack 5 compatible versions.

- Update `sass-loader`, `less-loader`, or other CSS preprocessor loaders if used
- Run `npm install` and resolve any compatibility issues

### Step 3: Configuration Migration
Update Webpack configuration files to use Webpack 5 syntax and features.

#### 3.1: Update Main Webpack Configuration
Modify the primary webpack configuration file for Webpack 5 compatibility.
- Update **`webpack.config.js`** to use new `mode` property if not already present
- Replace deprecated `optimization.splitChunks.cacheGroups.default` with new syntax
- Update `output.filename` and `output.chunkFilename` patterns for better caching
- Add `experiments` configuration for enabling new features if needed
- Remove or update deprecated options like `optimization.namedModules` and `optimization.namedChunks`

#### 3.2: Configure Asset Modules
Replace file-loader and url-loader with Webpack 5's built-in Asset Modules.
- Remove `file-loader` and `url-loader` rules from **`webpack.config.js`**
- Add Asset Module rules for images: `{ test: /\.(png|jpe?g|gif|svg)$/i, type: 'asset/resource' }`
- Add Asset Module rules for fonts: `{ test: /\.(woff|woff2|eot|ttf|otf)$/i, type: 'asset/resource' }`
- Configure `parser.dataUrlCondition.maxSize` for inline asset threshold
- Update any hardcoded file-loader or url-loader references in the codebase

#### 3.3: Update Plugin Configurations
Modify plugin configurations to match Webpack 5 API changes.
- Update `HtmlWebpackPlugin` configuration for any deprecated options
- Replace `OptimizeCSSAssetsPlugin` with `CssMinimizerPlugin` in optimization.minimizer
- Update `MiniCssExtractPlugin` configuration for new filename patterns
- Remove `webpack.NamedModulesPlugin` and `webpack.NamedChunksPlugin` (now default in development)
- Update any custom plugin configurations based on their Webpack 5 migration guides

### Step 4: Resolve Breaking Changes
Address specific Webpack 5 breaking changes that affect the application code.

#### 4.1: Fix Node.js Polyfills
Configure Node.js polyfills that are no longer included by default in Webpack 5.
- Identify usage of Node.js modules in browser code (process, Buffer, etc.)
- Install required polyfills: `npm install --save-dev process buffer crypto-browserify stream-browserify`
- Add `resolve.fallback` configuration in **`webpack.config.js`** for required polyfills
- Add `ProvidePlugin` configuration for global variables like `process` and `Buffer`
- Test that Node.js dependent code still works in the browser

#### 4.2: Update Dynamic Imports
Fix any dynamic import statements that may be affected by Webpack 5 changes.
- Search codebase for `import()` statements and `require.ensure()` usage
- Replace any `require.ensure()` calls with dynamic `import()` statements
- Update magic comments in dynamic imports for chunk naming (`/* webpackChunkName: "chunk-name" */`)
- Verify that code splitting still works as expected
- Update any lazy loading implementations that depend on webpack-specific APIs

#### 4.3: Fix Module Resolution Issues
Resolve any module resolution problems introduced by Webpack 5 changes.
- Update **`webpack.config.js`** `resolve.modules` if it includes absolute paths
- Fix any issues with `resolve.alias` configurations that may conflict with new resolution
- Update `resolve.extensions` if needed for new file types
- Verify that all imports resolve correctly, especially for CSS and asset files
- Test that barrel exports and re-exports work properly

### Step 5: Development Environment Updates
Update development server and build scripts for Webpack 5 compatibility.

- Update any custom middleware or proxy configurations

#### 5.2: Update Build Scripts
Modify npm scripts and build commands for Webpack 5.
- Update **`package.json`** scripts to use new webpack-cli syntax if needed
- Update any custom build scripts that invoke webpack programmatically
- Modify CI/CD pipeline configurations in **`.github/workflows/`** or similar
- Update Docker build files if they reference webpack commands
- Test all build scripts in different environments (development, staging, production)

### Step 6: Testing and Optimization
Verify the migration works correctly and optimize for Webpack 5 features.

#### 6.1: Enable Webpack 5 Optimizations
Configure new Webpack 5 features for improved performance.
- Enable persistent caching by adding `cache: { type: 'filesystem' }` to **`webpack.config.js`**
- Configure `optimization.splitChunks` with new `chunks: 'all'` strategy
- Enable tree shaking improvements with `optimization.usedExports: true`
- Configure `optimization.sideEffects: false` in **`package.json`** if applicable
- Add `experiments.topLevelAwait: true` if top-level await is used

#### 6.2: Update and Run Tests
Ensure all tests pass with the new Webpack configuration.
- Update any test configurations that depend on webpack (Jest, Karma, etc.)
- Fix any test files that mock webpack-specific functionality
- Update snapshot tests that may include webpack-generated content
- Run full test suite and fix any webpack-related test failures
- Add tests for new webpack features if applicable

#### 6.3: Performance Verification
Verify that the migration improves or maintains build performance.
- Run production builds and compare bundle sizes with Webpack 4
- Measure build times for both development and production modes
- Test hot module replacement functionality in development
- Verify that code splitting and lazy loading work as expected
- Document performance improvements in **`docs/webpack-migration-audit.md`**

## Manual testing plan
- Start development server with `npm run dev` and verify application loads correctly
- Test hot module replacement by making changes to CSS and JavaScript files
- Build production bundle with `npm run build` and verify all assets are generated
- Test the production build by serving it locally and checking functionality
- Verify that all dynamic imports and code splitting work in both development and production
- Check browser developer tools for any console errors or warnings
- Test application in different browsers to ensure compatibility
- Verify that source maps work correctly for debugging
- Test any custom webpack plugins or loaders specific to the project
- Confirm that CI/CD pipeline builds complete successfully
