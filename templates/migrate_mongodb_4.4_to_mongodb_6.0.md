# MongoDB 4.4 to 6.0 Migration Runbook
A comprehensive plan to upgrade MongoDB from version 4.4 to 6.0 with zero downtime and rollback capability.

## Summary of changes
- Current MongoDB 4.4 deployment requires upgrade to 6.0 for enhanced performance and security features
- Migration must go through intermediate version 5.0 as direct upgrade from 4.4 to 6.0 is not supported
- All application drivers and connection strings need compatibility verification and potential updates
- Database schema and indexes require validation for 6.0 compatibility
- Monitoring and alerting systems need updates for new MongoDB 6.0 metrics

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Pre-Migration Assessment and Planning
This step involves comprehensive analysis of the current MongoDB deployment and preparation of migration artifacts.

#### 1.1: Environment and Compatibility Audit
Create a comprehensive audit document of the current MongoDB 4.4 environment and identify potential compatibility issues.
- Create **`docs/mongodb-migration/environment-audit.md`** documenting current MongoDB configuration, replica set topology, and sharding setup
- Document all MongoDB driver versions used across applications in **`docs/mongodb-migration/driver-inventory.md`**
- Analyze current database schemas, indexes, and collections for 6.0 compatibility using MongoDB Compass or mongosh
- Identify deprecated features and operators currently in use that may be removed in 6.0
- Document current performance baselines including query performance, connection counts, and resource utilization

#### 1.2: Migration Strategy Documentation
Develop detailed migration strategy and rollback procedures to ensure safe upgrade path.
- Create **`docs/mongodb-migration/migration-strategy.md`** outlining the complete upgrade path (4.4 → 5.0 → 6.0)
- Document rollback procedures for each migration phase in **`docs/mongodb-migration/rollback-procedures.md`**
- Create timeline and maintenance window requirements in **`docs/mongodb-migration/migration-timeline.md`**
- Define success criteria and validation checkpoints for each migration phase
- Document communication plan for stakeholders and application teams

#### 1.3: Test Environment Setup
Prepare isolated test environments that mirror production for migration validation.
- Set up test MongoDB 4.4 cluster with production-like data using **`scripts/test-env/setup-test-cluster.sh`**
- Create data migration scripts in **`scripts/migration/data-sync.sh`** to sync production data to test environment
- Configure monitoring and logging for test environment using existing monitoring stack
- Validate all application connections work correctly in test environment
- Create automated test suite in **`tests/migration/`** directory to validate database functionality

### Step 2: Application Compatibility Preparation
Ensure all applications and drivers are compatible with MongoDB 5.0 and 6.0 before database upgrade.

#### 2.1: Driver Compatibility Updates
Update MongoDB drivers across all applications to versions compatible with both 5.0 and 6.0.

- Modify any custom MongoDB operations that may be affected by behavioral changes in 5.0/6.0
- Update error handling code to accommodate new error formats and codes
- Run full application test suites against MongoDB 5.0 test environment

### Step 3: MongoDB 5.0 Intermediate Upgrade
Perform the first phase of migration from MongoDB 4.4 to 5.0 as required intermediate step.

#### 3.1: Pre-5.0 Upgrade Validation
Validate the current 4.4 environment is ready for 5.0 upgrade and perform necessary preparations.
- Run **`db.adminCommand("listCollections")`** to ensure all collections have valid names for 5.0
- Execute **`db.runCommand({getParameter: 1, featureCompatibilityVersion: 1})`** to confirm current FCV is 4.4
- Verify all replica set members are healthy using **`rs.status()`** command
- Ensure all shards are balanced and no chunk migrations are in progress if using sharded clusters
- Create backup of current configuration using **`mongodump`** and store in **`backups/pre-5.0-upgrade/`**

#### 3.2: MongoDB 5.0 Binary Upgrade
Upgrade MongoDB binaries from 4.4 to 5.0 following rolling upgrade procedure for zero downtime.
