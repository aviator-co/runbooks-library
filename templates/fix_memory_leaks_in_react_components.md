# Fix Memory Leaks in React Components
Identify and resolve memory leaks in React components to improve application performance and prevent browser crashes.

## Summary of changes
- Audit existing React components to identify common memory leak patterns (event listeners, timers, subscriptions)
- Implement proper cleanup mechanisms in useEffect hooks and componentWillUnmount lifecycle methods
- Add ESLint rules and development tools to prevent future memory leaks
- Create monitoring and testing infrastructure to detect memory leaks in CI/CD pipeline

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Analysis and Documentation
Comprehensive audit of the codebase to identify memory leak sources and document findings.

#### 1.1: Memory Leak Audit
Conduct a thorough analysis of React components to identify potential memory leak sources.
- Scan all React components in **src/components** and **src/pages** directories for event listeners that aren't cleaned up
- Identify components using timers (setTimeout, setInterval) without proper cleanup
- Find components with subscriptions (WebSocket, EventSource, third-party libraries) lacking cleanup
- Document components using refs that might hold DOM references after unmounting
- Create **docs/memory-leak-audit.md** with findings categorized by leak type and severity

#### 1.2: Performance Baseline Establishment
Establish current memory usage baselines for monitoring improvements.
- Set up memory profiling using Chrome DevTools on key application flows
- Document current memory usage patterns in **docs/memory-baseline.md**
- Identify the top 10 components with highest memory impact
- Create reproducible test scenarios for memory leak detection
- Record baseline metrics for heap size, DOM nodes, and event listeners

### Step 2: Development Tooling Setup
Configure development tools and linting rules to catch memory leaks during development.

#### 2.1: ESLint Rules Configuration
Add ESLint rules to catch common memory leak patterns during development.
- Install and configure **eslint-plugin-react-hooks** with exhaustive-deps rule
- Add custom ESLint rules to detect missing cleanup in useEffect hooks
- Configure rules to flag setTimeout/setInterval usage without cleanup
- Update **.eslintrc.js** with memory leak prevention rules
- Add pre-commit hooks to run these linting checks

#### 2.2: Development Monitoring Tools
Integrate memory leak detection tools into the development workflow.
- Add **@welldone-software/why-did-you-render** for development environment
- Configure React DevTools Profiler integration for memory tracking
- Create **src/utils/memoryMonitor.js** utility for development memory tracking
- Add memory usage logging in development mode
- Update **package.json** with new development dependencies

### Step 3: Event Listener Cleanup
Fix components with improper event listener management.

#### 3.1: Global Event Listener Cleanup
Implement proper cleanup for components using global event listeners (window, document).
- Identify all components using window.addEventListener or document.addEventListener
- Refactor these components to use useEffect with proper cleanup functions
- Replace class component event listeners with useEffect equivalents where applicable
- Add cleanup functions that call removeEventListener with exact same parameters
- Update unit tests to verify event listener cleanup behavior

#### 3.2: Third-party Library Event Cleanup
Fix memory leaks from third-party library event subscriptions.
- Audit components using libraries like Socket.io, Firebase, or custom event emitters
- Implement proper unsubscribe/disconnect logic in cleanup functions
- Create custom hooks for commonly used third-party subscriptions
- Add error handling in cleanup functions to prevent cleanup failures
- Update integration tests to verify subscription cleanup

### Step 4: Timer and Interval Cleanup
Resolve memory leaks from uncleaned timers and intervals.

#### 4.1: setTimeout and setInterval Fixes
Implement proper cleanup for all timer-based operations.
- Identify all components using setTimeout or setInterval
- Store timer IDs in useRef or component instance variables
- Add clearTimeout/clearInterval calls in useEffect cleanup functions
- Replace class component timer usage with useEffect hook patterns
- Create **src/hooks/useTimer.js** custom hook for reusable timer logic

#### 4.2: Animation and Polling Cleanup
Fix memory leaks from animation frames and polling operations.
- Identify components using requestAnimationFrame without cleanup
- Implement cancelAnimationFrame in cleanup functions
- Fix polling operations that continue after component unmount
- Add proper cleanup for any recursive timer patterns
- Update components to use AbortController for fetch request cancellation

### Step 5: Subscription and Observer Cleanup
Fix memory leaks from various subscription patterns and observers.

#### 5.1: Observer Pattern Cleanup
Implement proper cleanup for MutationObserver, IntersectionObserver, and ResizeObserver.
- Audit components using any Observer APIs
- Add observer.disconnect() calls in useEffect cleanup functions
- Implement proper error handling for observer cleanup
- Create custom hooks for commonly used observers
- Add unit tests to verify observer cleanup behavior

#### 5.2: State Management Subscription Cleanup
Fix memory leaks from state management library subscriptions.
- Identify components subscribing to Redux, Zustand, or other state stores
- Implement proper unsubscribe logic in cleanup functions
- Fix any manual store subscriptions that bypass library hooks
- Add cleanup for any custom state management patterns
- Update components to use proper hook patterns for state subscriptions

### Step 6: Memory Leak Testing Infrastructure
Create automated testing to detect and prevent memory leaks.

#### 6.1: Memory Leak Test Suite
Develop automated tests to detect memory leaks in components.
- Create **src/tests/memoryLeak.test.js** with memory leak detection utilities
- Implement test helpers that mount/unmount components and check for leaks
- Add tests for each previously identified memory leak pattern
- Create performance tests that fail if memory usage exceeds thresholds
- Integrate memory leak tests into CI/CD pipeline

#### 6.2: Monitoring and Alerting
Set up production monitoring for memory-related issues.
- Implement client-side memory usage tracking in **src/utils/performanceMonitor.js**
- Add memory usage metrics to application analytics
- Create alerts for abnormal memory growth patterns
- Set up automated reporting for memory-related performance regressions
- Document memory monitoring procedures in **docs/memory-monitoring.md**

## Manual testing plan
- Load the application and navigate through all major user flows while monitoring memory usage in Chrome DevTools
- Perform repeated mount/unmount cycles of components that previously had memory leaks
- Use Chrome DevTools Memory tab to take heap snapshots before and after component interactions
- Verify that DOM node count remains stable after component unmounting
- Test application under heavy usage scenarios to ensure memory usage stays within acceptable bounds
- Validate that event listeners are properly removed by checking the Console tab for any cleanup errors
- Monitor memory usage during long-running sessions to ensure no gradual memory growth
- Test memory behavior on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) to ensure cross-browser compatibility
