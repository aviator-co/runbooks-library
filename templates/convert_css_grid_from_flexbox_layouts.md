Convert existing Flexbox-based layouts to CSS Grid for improved layout control and maintainability.

## Summary of changes
- Audit existing Flexbox implementations to identify candidates for Grid conversion
- Replace Flexbox properties with equivalent CSS Grid properties for better layout control
- Update responsive breakpoints and media queries to leverage Grid's native responsive capabilities
- Modernize layout patterns to take advantage of Grid's two-dimensional layout system

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Analysis and Planning
Conduct comprehensive analysis of current Flexbox usage and create conversion strategy.

#### 1.1: Audit Current Flexbox Usage
Create a comprehensive inventory of all Flexbox implementations across the codebase to identify conversion candidates.
- Scan all CSS files (`.css`, `.scss`, `.less`) for `display: flex` declarations
- Document each Flexbox container with its purpose, complexity, and child elements
- Identify nested Flexbox layouts that could benefit from Grid's two-dimensional approach
- Create **flexbox-audit.md** in the **docs/** directory with findings and conversion priorities

#### 1.2: Categorize Layout Patterns
Group Flexbox layouts by complexity and conversion priority to establish a systematic approach.
- Categorize layouts as Simple (single row/column), Complex (nested containers), or Hybrid (mixed with other layout methods)
- Prioritize layouts based on maintenance burden, performance impact, and Grid benefits
- Document conversion complexity estimates for each category
- Update **flexbox-audit.md** with categorization and priority rankings

#### 1.3: Create Conversion Strategy Document
Develop detailed conversion guidelines and standards for consistent Grid implementation.
- Create **css-grid-conversion-guide.md** in **docs/** directory with conversion patterns
- Define naming conventions for Grid areas, lines, and container classes
- Establish responsive Grid patterns and breakpoint strategies
- Document fallback strategies for older browser support requirements

### Step 2: Infrastructure Preparation
Set up tooling and base styles to support CSS Grid implementation.

#### 2.1: Update Build Tools and Linting
Configure development tools to support CSS Grid syntax and catch common Grid mistakes.
- Update **postcss.config.js** or equivalent to include CSS Grid autoprefixer rules
- Add CSS Grid linting rules to **.stylelintrc** or CSS linting configuration
- Update **package.json** dependencies for Grid-compatible CSS processing tools
- Test build pipeline with sample Grid syntax to ensure proper processing

#### 2.2: Create Grid Utility Classes
Establish foundational Grid utility classes and mixins for consistent implementation.
- Create **_grid-utilities.scss** in **styles/utilities/** directory with common Grid patterns
- Define utility classes for common grid layouts (2-column, 3-column, sidebar layouts)
- Create mixins for responsive Grid behavior and gap management
- Add Grid utility classes to main stylesheet imports

#### 2.3: Browser Support Assessment
Evaluate and document browser support requirements for CSS Grid implementation.
- Update **browser-support.md** in **docs/** with Grid compatibility requirements
- Configure CSS fallbacks for browsers that don't support Grid
- Set up feature detection for progressive enhancement where needed
- Document testing strategy for Grid layouts across supported browsers

### Step 3: Simple Layout Conversions
Convert straightforward single-dimension Flexbox layouts to CSS Grid.

#### 3.1: Convert Basic Navigation Layouts
Replace simple horizontal navigation Flexbox with Grid for better alignment control.
- Identify navigation components using `display: flex` for horizontal alignment
- Replace Flexbox properties with `display: grid` and `grid-template-columns`
- Update spacing from `justify-content` and `gap` to `grid-gap` or `gap`
- Test navigation responsiveness and alignment across different screen sizes

#### 3.2: Convert Card Grid Layouts
Transform Flexbox card containers to CSS Grid for more predictable card sizing.
- Locate card container components using Flexbox for grid-like arrangements
- Replace `display: flex` with `display: grid` and define `grid-template-columns`
- Convert `flex-wrap` behavior to implicit Grid rows with `grid-auto-rows`
- Update card component styles to work within Grid context instead of Flex items

#### 3.3: Convert Form Layouts
Migrate form layouts from Flexbox to Grid for better field alignment and spacing.
- Identify form components using Flexbox for field arrangement
- Replace Flexbox properties with Grid template areas for semantic layout definition
- Update form field sizing from `flex-grow`/`flex-shrink` to Grid fractional units
- Test form layouts across different input types and validation states

### Step 4: Complex Layout Conversions
Convert multi-dimensional and nested Flexbox layouts to take advantage of Grid's two-dimensional capabilities.

#### 4.1: Convert Dashboard Layouts
Transform complex dashboard layouts from nested Flexbox to single Grid container.
- Identify dashboard components with multiple levels of nested Flexbox containers
- Design Grid template areas that replace the nested container structure
- Convert widget positioning from Flexbox alignment to Grid area placement
- Update responsive behavior to use Grid's native responsive capabilities

#### 4.2: Convert Article/Content Layouts
Migrate article and content layouts to Grid for better typography and media integration.
- Locate article/content components using Flexbox for text and media arrangement
- Replace Flexbox layouts with Grid template areas for content sections
- Update image and media positioning to use Grid placement properties
- Ensure text flow and responsive behavior work correctly with Grid

#### 4.3: Convert Sidebar Layouts
Transform sidebar layouts from Flexbox to Grid for more flexible content arrangement.
- Identify main layout containers using Flexbox for sidebar and content areas
- Replace with Grid template areas defining sidebar, main content, and header regions
- Update sidebar collapse/expand behavior to work with Grid template modifications
- Test sidebar responsiveness and content overflow handling

### Step 5: Responsive and Advanced Features
Implement advanced Grid features and optimize responsive behavior.

#### 5.1: Implement Grid Template Areas
Add semantic Grid template areas to improve layout maintainability and readability.
- Define named Grid areas for major layout sections using `grid-template-areas`
- Update child elements to use `grid-area` property instead of positioning properties
- Create responsive Grid area redefinition for different screen sizes
- Document Grid area naming conventions in **css-grid-conversion-guide.md**

#### 5.2: Optimize Responsive Grid Behavior
