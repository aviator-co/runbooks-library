# Migrate File Storage to Cloud Storage
Migrate the application's local file storage system to a cloud-based storage solution (AWS S3) to improve scalability, reliability, and reduce infrastructure costs.

## Summary of changes
- Current application uses local filesystem for storing user uploads, documents, and static assets
- Migration will introduce AWS S3 as the primary storage backend with fallback mechanisms
- Implement gradual migration strategy to ensure zero downtime and data integrity
- Add configuration management for cloud storage credentials and settings
- Update file handling APIs to support both local and cloud storage during transition period
