Set up the core testing libraries and tools required for React component testing.
- Install **@testing-library/react**, **@testing-library/jest-dom**, and **@testing-library/user-event** as dev dependencies
- Install **jest-environment-jsdom** for proper DOM simulation in tests
- Add **@testing-library/jest-dom/extend-expect** to Jest setup files for enhanced matchers
- Update **package.json** scripts to include component test commands

#### 1.2: Configure Jest and Testing Environment
Configure Jest specifically for React component testing with proper setup and teardown.
- Create or update **jest.config.js** with React-specific settings and test environment configuration
- Set up **setupTests.js** file to import testing library extensions and configure global test utilities
- Configure **testPathIgnorePatterns** and **moduleNameMapping** for proper module resolution
- Add custom Jest matchers for component-specific assertions

#### 1.3: Create Testing Utilities and Helpers
Develop reusable testing utilities to standardize component testing approaches across the codebase.
- Create **src/test-utils/render.js** with custom render function that includes common providers (Router, Theme, etc.)
- Implement **src/test-utils/mocks.js** with commonly used mocks for external dependencies
- Set up **src/test-utils/fixtures.js** with sample data and props for consistent testing
- Create **src/test-utils/accessibility.js** with helpers for accessibility testing

### Step 2: Component Inventory and Analysis
Systematically catalog and analyze existing React components to plan comprehensive testing coverage.

#### 2.1: Component Discovery and Categorization
Identify all React components in the codebase and categorize them by complexity and testing requirements.
- Scan **src/components** directory and subdirectories to create comprehensive component inventory
- Categorize components as Presentational, Container, or Compound components in **docs/component-inventory.md**
- Identify components with external dependencies, complex state management, or integration requirements
- Document current test coverage status for each component using coverage reports

#### 2.2: Testing Priority Assessment
Evaluate and prioritize components for testing based on business impact and technical complexity.
- Analyze component usage patterns using static analysis tools to identify high-impact components
- Document critical user paths and components involved in **docs/testing-priorities.md**
- Assess technical complexity including props, state, lifecycle methods, and external integrations
- Create testing roadmap with priority levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low) for systematic implementation

### Step 3: Core Component Testing Implementation
Implement comprehensive test suites for fundamental and high-priority components.

#### 3.1: Test Presentational Components
Create thorough test coverage for presentational components focusing on rendering and prop handling.
- Write tests for **Button**, **Input**, **Card**, and other basic UI components in their respective **.test.js** files
- Test all prop variations, default values, and conditional rendering logic using data-driven test approaches
- Implement snapshot tests for visual regression detection and component structure validation
- Add accessibility tests using **@testing-library/jest-dom** matchers for ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation

#### 3.2: Test Container Components
Develop comprehensive tests for container components that manage state and handle business logic.
- Create tests for components like **UserProfile**, **ProductList**, and **ShoppingCart** focusing on state management
- Mock external API calls and services using **jest.mock()** and verify proper data handling
- Test user interactions using **@testing-library/user-event** for clicks, form submissions, and navigation
- Implement integration tests that verify component communication and data flow

#### 3.3: Test Compound Components
Build test suites for complex compound components that combine multiple sub-components.
- Test components like **DataTable**, **Modal**, **Wizard** that have multiple interactive parts
- Verify proper composition and communication between parent and child components
- Test complex user workflows and multi-step interactions using realistic user scenarios
- Implement tests for edge cases, error states, and loading conditions

### Step 4: Advanced Testing Scenarios
Implement specialized testing for complex scenarios including async operations, context usage, and custom hooks.

#### 4.1: Test Async Components and Data Fetching
Create comprehensive tests for components that handle asynchronous operations and external data.
- Test components with **useEffect** hooks that fetch data using **waitFor** and **findBy** queries
- Mock API responses with **msw** (Mock Service Worker) for realistic network simulation
- Test loading states, success scenarios, and error handling with proper async/await patterns
- Verify proper cleanup and cancellation of async operations in component unmount scenarios

#### 4.2: Test Context and Provider Components
Develop tests for components that use React Context and provide/consume shared state.
- Test **ThemeProvider**, **AuthProvider**, and other context providers with multiple consumer scenarios
- Verify context value changes propagate correctly to all consuming components
- Test context error boundaries and fallback scenarios for robust error handling
- Implement integration tests that verify context behavior across component hierarchies

#### 4.3: Test Custom Hooks Integration
Create tests for components that use custom hooks and verify proper hook behavior.
- Test components using **useLocalStorage**, **useApi**, and other custom hooks with mock implementations
- Verify hook return values are properly consumed and displayed in component UI
- Test hook error states and edge cases through component integration tests
- Implement tests for hook cleanup and memory leak prevention

### Step 5: Testing Standards and Documentation
Establish testing standards, guidelines, and documentation to ensure consistent quality across the team.

#### 5.1: Create Testing Guidelines Document
Develop comprehensive testing standards and best practices documentation for the development team.
- Create **docs/component-testing-guidelines.md** with testing patterns, naming conventions, and code organization standards
- Document when to use different testing approaches (unit vs integration vs snapshot tests)
- Establish guidelines for test data management, mocking strategies, and assertion patterns
- Include examples of well-written tests and common anti-patterns to avoid

#### 5.2: Implement Test Coverage Requirements
Set up test coverage monitoring and establish minimum coverage thresholds for component testing.
- Configure Jest coverage collection for component files with appropriate thresholds (80% line coverage minimum)
- Set up coverage reporting in **package.json** scripts and integrate with CI/CD pipeline
- Create coverage exclusion rules for generated files, third-party components, and utility functions
- Implement pre-commit hooks that prevent commits below coverage thresholds

#### 5.3: Create Component Testing Templates
Develop standardized templates and scaffolding tools to accelerate future component test creation.
- Create **templates/component-test.template.js** with standard test structure and common test cases
- Develop CLI script or generator for creating new component test files with proper boilerplate
- Include templates for different component types (presentational, container, compound) with relevant test patterns
- Document template usage and customization guidelines in **docs/testing-templates.md**

### Step 6: CI/CD Integration and Quality Gates
Integrate component tests into the continuous integration pipeline to ensure consistent quality and prevent regressions.
