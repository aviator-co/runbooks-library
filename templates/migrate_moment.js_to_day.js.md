# Migrate Moment.js to Day.js
Replace Moment.js with Day.js across the codebase to reduce bundle size and improve performance while maintaining date/time functionality.

## Summary of changes
- Moment.js is a large library (67KB minified) that has been deprecated and is no longer recommended for new projects
- Day.js is a lightweight alternative (2KB minified) with similar API and extensive plugin support
- Migration involves updating dependencies, replacing imports, updating date manipulation logic, and ensuring timezone handling compatibility
- All existing date/time functionality will be preserved with improved performance and smaller bundle size

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Analysis and Planning
Comprehensive analysis of current Moment.js usage to plan migration strategy.

#### 1.1: Audit Current Moment.js Usage
Create a comprehensive audit of all Moment.js usage patterns across the codebase to understand migration scope.
- Search for all `moment` imports and requires across the entire codebase using `grep -r "import.*moment\|require.*moment" src/`
- Document all Moment.js methods being used (format, parse, add, subtract, diff, etc.) in **`docs/moment-audit.md`**
- Identify any custom Moment.js plugins or locale configurations currently in use
- List all test files that use Moment.js for date mocking or assertions
- Document any third-party libraries that might have Moment.js dependencies

#### 1.2: Create Migration Strategy Document
Develop a detailed migration strategy based on the audit findings.
- Create **`docs/dayjs-migration-strategy.md`** outlining the migration approach
- Document Day.js plugin requirements for each Moment.js feature (timezone, utc, customParseFormat, etc.)
- Identify any breaking changes or behavioral differences between Moment.js and Day.js
- Plan the order of file migrations to minimize integration issues
- Document rollback strategy in case of critical issues

### Step 2: Dependency Management
Update package dependencies to introduce Day.js while maintaining Moment.js temporarily.

#### 2.1: Install Day.js and Required Plugins
Add Day.js as a dependency alongside the existing Moment.js installation.
- Run `npm install dayjs` to add Day.js to **`package.json`**
- Install commonly needed Day.js plugins: `npm install dayjs/plugin/utc dayjs/plugin/timezone dayjs/plugin/customParseFormat dayjs/plugin/relativeTime dayjs/plugin/duration`
- Update **`package-lock.json`** by running `npm install`
- Verify installation by checking that Day.js appears in **`node_modules`**

#### 2.2: Create Day.js Configuration Module
Set up a centralized Day.js configuration to handle plugins and global settings.
- Create **`src/utils/dayjs-config.js`** with Day.js initialization and plugin registration
- Import and configure all necessary Day.js plugins (utc, timezone, customParseFormat, relativeTime, duration)
- Set default timezone and locale configurations to match current Moment.js setup
- Export configured Day.js instance for use throughout the application
- Add unit tests in **`src/utils/__tests__/dayjs-config.test.js`** to verify plugin functionality
