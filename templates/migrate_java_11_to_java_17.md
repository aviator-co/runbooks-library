# Java 11 to Java 17 Migration Runbook
Comprehensive migration plan to upgrade Java runtime from version 11 to 17 while maintaining backward compatibility and ensuring all systems continue to function properly.

## Summary of changes
- Current codebase is running on Java 11 and needs to be upgraded to Java 17 for improved performance, security, and access to newer language features
- Migration involves updating build configurations, dependencies, CI/CD pipelines, deployment scripts, and addressing any compatibility issues
- Changes will be implemented incrementally to ensure the application remains buildable and testable at each step
- All environments (development, staging, production) will be updated with proper validation at each stage

## Execution Steps
