# Implement Smart Test Execution
A system that intelligently selects and runs only the tests affected by code changes, reducing CI/CD pipeline execution time while maintaining test coverage confidence.

## Summary of changes
- Current test suite runs all tests on every commit, leading to long CI/CD pipeline times and resource waste
- Implement a dependency tracking system that maps code files to their corresponding test files and dependencies
- Create a change detection mechanism that identifies modified files and determines which tests need to run
- Add configuration options for fallback to full test suite execution and smart execution bypass
- Integrate the smart test execution into existing CI/CD pipeline with proper reporting and metrics

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Analysis and Foundation
Initial research and setup of core infrastructure for smart test execution.

#### 1.1: Codebase Analysis and Documentation
Analyze the current test structure and create a comprehensive mapping document.
- Audit existing test files and their naming conventions across the codebase
- Document current test execution patterns and identify bottlenecks in CI/CD pipeline
- Create **analysis/smart-test-execution-analysis.md** with findings on test structure, execution times, and dependency patterns
- Identify test frameworks in use and their capabilities for selective execution

#### 1.2: Design Smart Test Execution Architecture
Design the overall architecture and create technical specification document.
- Create **docs/smart-test-execution-design.md** with system architecture, component interactions, and data flow diagrams
- Define the dependency mapping strategy (static analysis vs runtime tracking vs hybrid approach)
- Specify configuration schema for smart test execution settings
- Document integration points with existing CI/CD pipeline and build tools

#### 1.3: Setup Core Infrastructure
Create the foundational directory structure and configuration files.
- Create **smart-test/** directory in project root for all smart test execution components
- Add **smart-test/config/** directory for configuration files and schemas
- Create **smart-test/src/** directory for core implementation files
- Initialize **smart-test/package.json** or equivalent dependency management file for the smart test module

### Step 2: Dependency Mapping System
Implement the core system that tracks relationships between code files and tests.

#### 2.1: Static Code Analysis Engine
Build a system to analyze code dependencies and create mappings.
- Implement **smart-test/src/dependency-analyzer.js** that parses source files and extracts import/require statements
- Create **smart-test/src/test-mapper.js** that identifies test files and maps them to source files based on naming conventions and import patterns
- Add support for multiple file extensions and test frameworks (Jest, Mocha, Pytest, etc.)
- Implement caching mechanism in **smart-test/src/cache-manager.js** to store dependency mappings

#### 2.2: Configuration Management
Create configuration system for customizing smart test execution behavior.
- Implement **smart-test/src/config-loader.js** that reads and validates configuration from multiple sources
- Create **smart-test/config/default-config.json** with default settings for dependency mapping rules, test patterns, and execution thresholds
- Add **smart-test/config/schema.json** for configuration validation
- Support environment-specific overrides and command-line parameter integration

#### 2.3: Dependency Graph Builder
Build a comprehensive dependency graph for the entire codebase.
- Implement **smart-test/src/graph-builder.js** that creates a directed graph of file dependencies
- Add support for transitive dependency resolution to handle indirect relationships
- Create **smart-test/src/graph-serializer.js** for persisting and loading dependency graphs
- Implement graph validation and cycle detection mechanisms

### Step 3: Change Detection and Test Selection
Implement the core logic for detecting changes and selecting relevant tests.

#### 3.1: Change Detection Engine
Create a system to identify modified files since the last test run.
- Implement **smart-test/src/change-detector.js** that integrates with Git to identify modified, added, and deleted files
- Add support for different change detection strategies (commit-based, branch-based, timestamp-based)
- Create **smart-test/src/file-hasher.js** for content-based change detection as a fallback
- Implement change filtering to exclude non-relevant files (documentation, configuration files based on rules)

#### 3.2: Test Selection Algorithm
Build the core algorithm that determines which tests to run based on changes.
- Implement **smart-test/src/test-selector.js** with the main selection logic using the dependency graph
- Add support for different selection strategies (direct dependencies, transitive dependencies, risk-based selection)
- Create **smart-test/src/impact-analyzer.js** that calculates the potential impact of changes
- Implement confidence scoring system to determine when full test suite execution is needed

#### 3.3: Test Execution Coordinator
Create the orchestration layer for running selected tests.
- Implement **smart-test/src/execution-coordinator.js** that interfaces with existing test runners
- Add support for parallel test execution and resource management
- Create **smart-test/src/test-runner-adapters/** directory with adapters for different test frameworks
- Implement fallback mechanisms for when smart selection fails or confidence is low

### Step 4: Reporting and Integration
Build reporting capabilities and integrate with existing development workflow.

#### 4.1: Reporting and Metrics System
Create comprehensive reporting for smart test execution results.
- Implement **smart-test/src/reporter.js** that generates execution reports with test selection rationale
- Create **smart-test/src/metrics-collector.js** for tracking time savings, test coverage, and selection accuracy
- Add **smart-test/templates/** directory with HTML and JSON report templates
- Implement integration with existing test reporting tools and dashboards

#### 4.2: CLI Interface and Integration
Build command-line interface for manual execution and debugging.
- Create **smart-test/bin/smart-test-cli.js** with commands for running smart tests, updating dependencies, and generating reports
- Add **smart-test/src/cli-commands/** directory with individual command implementations
- Implement debug mode with verbose logging and dependency graph visualization
- Create help documentation and usage examples in the CLI

#### 4.3: CI/CD Pipeline Integration
Integrate smart test execution into existing continuous integration workflows.
- Update **.github/workflows/** or equivalent CI configuration files to use smart test execution
- Create **smart-test/ci-integration/** directory with scripts and configurations for different CI platforms
- Implement environment detection to automatically enable/disable smart execution based on context
- Add pipeline stage for dependency graph updates and cache management

### Step 5: Testing and Validation
Comprehensive testing of the smart test execution system itself.

#### 5.1: Unit and Integration Tests
Create thorough test coverage for all smart test execution components.
- Add **smart-test/tests/unit/** directory with unit tests for all core modules
- Create **smart-test/tests/integration/** directory with integration tests for end-to-end workflows
- Implement **smart-test/tests/fixtures/** with sample codebases for testing different scenarios
- Add performance tests to ensure smart execution is actually faster than full test suite

#### 5.2: Validation and Benchmarking
Validate the accuracy and performance of the smart test execution system.
- Create **smart-test/validation/** directory with scripts to compare smart execution results against full test runs
- Implement benchmarking tools to measure time savings and resource utilization
- Add **smart-test/tests/regression/** directory with tests to prevent accuracy degradation
- Create monitoring and alerting for when smart execution confidence drops below thresholds

## Manual testing plan
- Run smart test execution on a feature branch with isolated changes and verify only relevant tests are selected
- Test the system with various types of changes (new files, deleted files, refactored code) to ensure proper test selection
- Verify fallback to full test suite execution when confidence is low or when critical files are modified
- Test CI/CD integration by creating pull requests and ensuring smart test execution runs automatically
- Validate reporting accuracy by comparing smart execution results with full test suite results
- Test configuration overrides and CLI commands in different environments and scenarios
- Verify performance improvements by measuring execution time before and after implementation on representative codebases
