# Implement Breadcrumb Navigation
Add a reusable breadcrumb navigation component to improve user navigation and provide clear page hierarchy context.

## Summary of changes
- Create a new breadcrumb component with configurable navigation paths
- Integrate breadcrumb component into existing page layouts and routing system
- Add styling and responsive design support for breadcrumb navigation
- Implement accessibility features and keyboard navigation support
- Add comprehensive testing coverage for breadcrumb functionality

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Component Foundation
Create the core breadcrumb component structure and basic functionality.

#### 1.1: Create Breadcrumb Component Structure
Create the main breadcrumb component with TypeScript interfaces and basic rendering logic.
- Create **src/components/Breadcrumb/index.ts** as the main export file
- Create **src/components/Breadcrumb/Breadcrumb.tsx** with basic component structure and props interface
- Define `BreadcrumbItem` interface with `label`, `href`, and optional `icon` properties
- Implement basic rendering of breadcrumb items with separators
- Add **src/components/Breadcrumb/types.ts** for shared type definitions

#### 1.2: Add Breadcrumb Styling
Implement CSS modules and responsive styling for the breadcrumb component.
- Create **src/components/Breadcrumb/Breadcrumb.module.css** with base styles
- Add responsive breakpoints for mobile and desktop layouts
- Implement hover states and active item styling
- Add support for custom separator icons and spacing
- Include RTL (right-to-left) language support in styles

#### 1.3: Create Breadcrumb Hook
Develop a custom hook to manage breadcrumb state and navigation logic.
- Create **src/hooks/useBreadcrumb.ts** with breadcrumb state management
- Implement functions to build breadcrumb paths from current route
- Add support for dynamic breadcrumb generation based on URL parameters
- Include breadcrumb history management for back navigation
- Add utility functions for breadcrumb item manipulation

### Step 2: Integration and Routing
Integrate breadcrumb component with the existing routing system and page layouts.

#### 2.1: Router Integration
Connect breadcrumb component with the application's routing system to automatically generate navigation paths.
- Modify **src/router/index.ts** to include breadcrumb metadata in route definitions
- Add `breadcrumbLabel` and `breadcrumbIcon` properties to route configuration
- Implement route hierarchy mapping for nested breadcrumb generation
- Create breadcrumb context provider in **src/contexts/BreadcrumbContext.tsx**
- Update main **App.tsx** to wrap application with breadcrumb context

#### 2.2: Layout Integration
Add breadcrumb component to main page layouts and establish consistent placement.
- Update **src/layouts/MainLayout.tsx** to include breadcrumb component
- Add breadcrumb placement logic based on page type and user permissions
- Implement conditional breadcrumb rendering for specific routes
- Create **src/components/PageHeader/PageHeader.tsx** component that includes breadcrumbs
- Update existing page components to use new PageHeader component

#### 2.3: Dynamic Breadcrumb Generation
Implement logic to generate breadcrumbs dynamically based on current page context.
- Create **src/utils/breadcrumbUtils.ts** with helper functions for breadcrumb generation
- Add support for parameterized routes (e.g., `/users/:id` becomes `/users/John Doe`)
- Implement breadcrumb customization through page-level configuration
- Add support for conditional breadcrumb items based on user permissions
- Create breadcrumb cache mechanism for performance optimization

### Step 3: Accessibility and User Experience
Enhance the breadcrumb component with accessibility features and improved user experience.

#### 3.1: Accessibility Implementation
Add comprehensive accessibility support including ARIA labels and keyboard navigation.
- Implement ARIA navigation landmark and breadcrumb list semantics
- Add `aria-current="page"` for the current page breadcrumb item
- Include screen reader support with descriptive labels
- Add keyboard navigation support (Tab, Enter, Arrow keys)
- Implement focus management and visual focus indicators

#### 3.2: Advanced Features
Add enhanced functionality like breadcrumb truncation and mobile optimization.
- Implement breadcrumb truncation for long navigation paths
- Add ellipsis menu for collapsed breadcrumb items
- Create mobile-responsive breadcrumb design with swipe navigation
- Add breadcrumb dropdown for deeply nested hierarchies
- Implement breadcrumb search functionality for large site structures

#### 3.3: Performance Optimization
Optimize breadcrumb component performance and loading behavior.
- Add lazy loading for breadcrumb icons and dynamic content
- Implement breadcrumb memoization to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Add breadcrumb preloading for anticipated navigation paths
- Create breadcrumb analytics tracking for user navigation patterns
- Optimize bundle size by code-splitting breadcrumb-related utilities

### Step 4: Testing and Documentation
Create comprehensive test coverage and documentation for the breadcrumb system.

#### 4.1: Unit Testing
Create unit tests for breadcrumb component and related utilities.
- Create **src/components/Breadcrumb/__tests__/Breadcrumb.test.tsx** with component tests
- Add tests for **src/hooks/__tests__/useBreadcrumb.test.ts** hook functionality
- Test breadcrumb generation utilities in **src/utils/__tests__/breadcrumbUtils.test.ts**
- Add accessibility testing with jest-axe and testing-library
- Create snapshot tests for different breadcrumb configurations

#### 4.2: Integration Testing
Develop integration tests for breadcrumb navigation and routing behavior.
- Create **src/__tests__/integration/breadcrumb-navigation.test.tsx** for end-to-end scenarios
- Test breadcrumb behavior across different route transitions
- Add tests for breadcrumb context provider and consumer interactions
- Test breadcrumb responsiveness across different viewport sizes
- Create performance tests for breadcrumb rendering and navigation

#### 4.3: Documentation and Examples
Create comprehensive documentation and usage examples for the breadcrumb system.
- Create **docs/components/breadcrumb.md** with component API documentation
- Add usage examples and configuration options documentation
- Create **src/stories/Breadcrumb.stories.tsx** for Storybook integration
- Document accessibility features and best practices
- Add troubleshooting guide for common breadcrumb implementation issues

## Manual testing plan
- Navigate through different pages and verify breadcrumb paths are correctly generated
- Test breadcrumb clicking functionality to ensure proper navigation
- Verify breadcrumb appearance and behavior on mobile devices and tablets
- Test keyboard navigation using Tab, Enter, and Arrow keys
- Verify screen reader compatibility using NVDA or JAWS
- Test breadcrumb truncation with deeply nested page hierarchies
- Validate breadcrumb styling consistency across different themes
- Test breadcrumb performance with rapid navigation between pages
- Verify breadcrumb context updates correctly when route parameters change
- Test breadcrumb behavior with browser back/forward navigation
