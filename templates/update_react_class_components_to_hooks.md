# Update React Class Components to Hooks
Convert existing React class components to functional components using hooks for improved performance and maintainability.

## Summary of changes
- Audit existing codebase to identify all class components that can be converted to hooks
- Create utility functions and custom hooks to support the migration
- Systematically convert class components to functional components with hooks
- Update tests and documentation to reflect the new patterns
- Remove deprecated lifecycle methods and class-based patterns

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Analysis and Planning
Establish baseline understanding of current class components and create migration strategy.

#### 1.1: Audit Existing Class Components
Create comprehensive inventory of all class components in the codebase to plan conversion priority.
- Scan all **src/** directories for files containing `class.*extends.*Component` or `extends React.Component`
- Create **docs/hooks-migration-audit.md** documenting each class component with:\
  - File path and component name\
  - Lifecycle methods used\
  - State complexity (simple/complex)\
  - Props usage patterns\
  - Dependencies on other class components
- Categorize components by conversion complexity (simple, medium, complex)
- Identify shared patterns that could benefit from custom hooks

#### 1.2: Create Migration Strategy Document
Document the step-by-step approach for converting components based on audit findings.
- Create **docs/hooks-migration-strategy.md** with:\
  - Conversion priority order (leaf components first)\
  - Standard patterns for common lifecycle method conversions\
  - Custom hooks that need to be created\
  - Breaking changes and compatibility considerations
- Define coding standards for hook usage and component structure
- Establish testing requirements for converted components

### Step 2: Infrastructure Setup
Create supporting utilities and custom hooks needed for the migration.

#### 2.1: Create Common Custom Hooks
Develop reusable custom hooks for common patterns found in class components.
- Create **src/hooks/index.js** as the main hooks export file
- Implement **src/hooks/useComponentDidMount.js** for `componentDidMount` equivalent
- Implement **src/hooks/useComponentWillUnmount.js** for cleanup logic
- Implement **src/hooks/usePrevious.js** for accessing previous props/state values
- Add comprehensive unit tests in **src/hooks/__tests__/** for all custom hooks

#### 2.2: Create Lifecycle Method Conversion Utilities
Build helper functions to ease the transition from class lifecycle methods.
- Create **src/utils/hookHelpers.js** with utility functions for:\
  - Converting `componentDidUpdate` logic to `useEffect` dependencies\
  - Handling complex state updates that previously used `setState` callbacks\
  - Managing ref forwarding patterns
- Add unit tests in **src/utils/__tests__/hookHelpers.test.js**
- Update **src/utils/index.js** to export new helper functions

### Step 3: Simple Component Conversion
Convert leaf components with minimal state and simple lifecycle methods.

#### 3.1: Convert Simple Stateless Class Components
Transform class components that only use props and have no state or lifecycle methods.
- Identify components from audit that have no state or lifecycle methods
- Convert each component by:\
  - Replacing class declaration with function declaration\
  - Converting `render()` method content to function return\
  - Updating prop access from `this.props.x` to destructured props
- Update corresponding test files to test functional components instead of class instances
- Update any parent components that were using ref callbacks to access these components

#### 3.2: Convert Simple Stateful Components
Transform class components with basic state usage and simple lifecycle methods.
- Convert components using only `constructor` and `componentDidMount`/`componentWillUnmount`
- Replace `this.state` with `useState` hooks
- Replace `componentDidMount` with `useEffect(() => {}, [])`
- Replace `componentWillUnmount` with `useEffect(() => { return () => {} }, [])`
- Update tests to use React Testing Library patterns instead of enzyme instance methods
- Verify all converted components render correctly and maintain existing functionality

### Step 4: Medium Complexity Component Conversion
Convert components with multiple lifecycle methods and moderate state complexity.

#### 4.1: Convert Components with componentDidUpdate
Transform components that use `componentDidUpdate` for side effects based on prop/state changes.
- Identify components using `componentDidUpdate` from the audit
- Convert `componentDidUpdate` logic to appropriate `useEffect` hooks with proper dependencies
- Use `usePrevious` custom hook where previous values comparison is needed
- Replace complex `setState` callbacks with `useEffect` hooks that depend on state changes
- Update tests to verify effect behavior using `waitFor` and proper async testing patterns

#### 4.2: Convert Components with Complex State Management
Transform components with multiple state properties and complex state update patterns.
- Convert multiple `this.state` properties to either:\
  - Multiple `useState` calls for independent state\
  - Single `useReducer` for complex interdependent state
- Replace `setState` with functional updates where state depends on previous state
- Convert any `setState` callback patterns to separate `useEffect` hooks
- Update tests to verify state updates work correctly with new hook patterns

### Step 5: Complex Component Conversion
Convert components with advanced patterns, context usage, and error boundaries.

#### 5.1: Convert Context Consumer Components
Transform class components that consume React Context using legacy patterns.
- Identify components using `static contextType` or `Context.Consumer` render props
- Replace `this.context` usage with `useContext` hook
- Update context consumption patterns from render props to hook-based access
- Ensure context updates trigger re-renders correctly in converted components
- Update tests to mock context providers appropriately for functional components

#### 5.2: Convert Components with Error Boundaries
Handle components that implement error boundary lifecycle methods.
- Identify components implementing `componentDidCatch` or `getDerivedStateFromError`
- Document that error boundaries must remain as class components (React limitation)
- For components that are wrapped by error boundaries, ensure conversion doesn't break error handling
- Update error boundary components to handle functional component errors correctly
- Test error scenarios to ensure error boundaries still catch and handle errors properly

### Step 6: Advanced Patterns and Optimization
Handle remaining complex cases and optimize converted components.

#### 6.1: Convert Higher-Order Components (HOCs)
Transform class-based HOCs to use hooks or render props patterns.
- Identify HOCs that wrap class components from the audit
- Convert HOCs to custom hooks where appropriate
- For HOCs that must remain as components, ensure they work with functional components
- Update HOC usage throughout the codebase to work with converted components
- Test HOC functionality with both class and functional component consumers

#### 6.2: Performance Optimization with React.memo
Add performance optimizations to converted functional components where beneficial.
- Identify components that previously used `PureComponent` or custom `shouldComponentUpdate`
- Wrap appropriate functional components with `React.memo`
- Create custom comparison functions for `React.memo` where shallow comparison isn't sufficient
- Use `useCallback` and `useMemo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders in child components
- Performance test converted components to ensure no regression in render performance

### Step 7: Testing and Documentation Updates
Update all tests and documentation to reflect the new hook-based patterns.

#### 7.1: Update Test Suites
Modernize test files to work with functional components and hooks.
- Replace enzyme `shallow` and `mount` with React Testing Library `render`
- Update test assertions from instance methods to DOM queries and user interactions
- Add tests for custom hooks using `@testing-library/react-hooks`
- Update snapshot tests to reflect functional component output
- Ensure test coverage remains at or above previous levels

#### 7.2: Update Documentation and Style Guides
Refresh all documentation to reflect the new component patterns.
- Update **README.md** and component documentation to show hook examples instead of class examples
- Create **docs/hooks-best-practices.md** with guidelines for:\
  - When to use different types of hooks\
  - Performance optimization patterns\
  - Testing strategies for hook-based components
- Update style guide and linting rules to prefer functional components
- Document any breaking changes or migration notes for other developers

### Step 8: Cleanup and Finalization
Remove deprecated patterns and finalize the migration.

#### 8.1: Remove Deprecated Utilities
Clean up class component utilities that are no longer needed.
- Remove any class component utility functions that are no longer used
- Update import statements throughout the codebase to remove unused class-related imports
- Remove deprecated lifecycle method polyfills or utilities
- Update package.json to remove any class component specific dependencies
- Run full test suite to ensure no broken imports or missing dependencies

#### 8.2: Final Validation and Performance Testing
Ensure the migration is complete and performant.
- Run comprehensive test suite across all environments
- Perform bundle size analysis to verify no significant size increase
- Conduct performance testing to ensure no rendering performance regression
- Update **docs/hooks-migration-audit.md** with final completion status
- Create migration summary document with lessons learned and metrics

## Manual testing plan
- Navigate through all major application flows to verify UI functionality remains unchanged
- Test user interactions (clicks, form submissions, navigation) work correctly with converted components
- Verify error scenarios still display appropriate error messages and boundaries work
- Test responsive design and CSS styling remains consistent across converted components
- Validate accessibility features (keyboard navigation, screen readers) work with functional components
- Performance test page load times and interaction responsiveness compared to baseline measurements
- Cross-browser testing to ensure hooks work consistently across supported browsers
- Test any third-party integrations that interact with the converted components
