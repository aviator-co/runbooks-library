# Implement Gradle Build Caching
Enable Gradle build cache to improve build performance by reusing outputs from previous builds and sharing cache across team members.

## Summary of changes
- Current build system lacks caching configuration, leading to repeated compilation of unchanged code
- Implement local build cache to speed up individual developer builds
- Configure remote build cache for team-wide cache sharing
- Add cache optimization settings and monitoring capabilities
- Update CI/CD pipeline to leverage build cache effectively

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Local Build Cache Setup
Configure basic local build caching to establish foundation for caching system.

#### 1.1: Enable Local Build Cache
Add build cache configuration to the root Gradle project to enable local caching.
- Create or modify **gradle.properties** file in project root to add `org.gradle.caching=true`
- Add build cache configuration block in **build.gradle** or **settings.gradle** file
- Configure cache directory location and retention policies
- Test local cache functionality with a simple build task

#### 1.2: Configure Cache Settings
Optimize local cache settings for better performance and storage management.
- Set cache size limits in **gradle.properties** using `org.gradle.caching.debug=true` for initial debugging
- Configure cache cleanup policies to prevent disk space issues
- Add cache hit/miss logging configuration for monitoring
- Update **.gitignore** to exclude local cache directories

#### 1.3: Validate Local Cache Functionality
Verify that local build cache is working correctly with existing build tasks.
- Run clean build twice and verify second build uses cached outputs
- Test cache behavior with different build variants (debug/release)
- Validate that cache invalidation works when source files change
- Document cache hit rates and performance improvements in **docs/build-cache-analysis.md**

### Step 2: Remote Build Cache Infrastructure
Set up shared remote build cache to enable team-wide cache sharing.

#### 2.1: Configure Remote Cache Backend
Set up remote build cache server or service for team collaboration.
- Choose and configure remote cache backend (Gradle Enterprise, HTTP cache, or cloud storage)
- Create cache server configuration in **gradle/remote-cache.gradle** file
- Add authentication and security settings for remote cache access
- Configure network timeout and retry policies for cache operations

#### 2.2: Enable Remote Cache in Build Configuration
Integrate remote cache settings into the build system.
- Modify **settings.gradle** to include remote cache configuration
- Add conditional logic to use remote cache only in CI and team environments
- Configure push/pull permissions for different user roles
- Add fallback mechanisms when remote cache is unavailable

#### 2.3: Update CI/CD Pipeline Configuration
Modify continuous integration setup to leverage remote build cache.
- Update **Jenkinsfile** or **.github/workflows** to enable cache push for main branch builds
- Configure cache pull for all builds to maximize cache utilization
- Add cache statistics reporting in CI build logs
- Set up cache warming strategies for frequently used build outputs

### Step 3: Cache Optimization and Monitoring
Implement advanced caching strategies and monitoring capabilities.

#### 3.1: Optimize Cacheable Tasks
Configure specific tasks for optimal caching behavior.
- Add `@CacheableTask` annotations to custom Gradle tasks
- Configure input/output specifications for better cache key generation
- Implement proper task input normalization for consistent cache keys
- Update existing custom tasks in **buildSrc** directory to support caching

#### 3.2: Add Cache Monitoring and Metrics
Implement monitoring to track cache effectiveness and performance.
- Create **gradle/cache-monitoring.gradle** script for cache statistics collection
- Add build scan configuration to track cache hit rates
- Implement cache performance reporting in build output
- Create dashboard or reporting mechanism for team cache usage metrics

#### 3.3: Configure Cache Exclusions and Inclusions
Fine-tune caching behavior for different types of tasks and outputs.
- Configure cache exclusions for tasks that shouldn't be cached (e.g., deployment tasks)
- Set up cache inclusion patterns for specific file types and directories
- Add environment-specific cache configurations
- Document caching strategy and guidelines in **docs/gradle-cache-strategy.md**

### Step 4: Documentation and Team Onboarding
Create comprehensive documentation and team guidelines for build cache usage.

#### 4.1: Create Developer Documentation
Document build cache setup and usage for team members.
- Create **docs/gradle-build-cache.md** with setup instructions and troubleshooting guide
- Document cache configuration options and their impact on build performance
- Add examples of cache hit/miss scenarios and debugging techniques
- Include best practices for maintaining cache effectiveness

#### 4.2: Update Build Scripts Documentation
Enhance existing build documentation to include cache-related information.
- Update **README.md** with cache setup instructions for new developers
- Document cache-related Gradle properties and their effects
- Add troubleshooting section for common cache issues
- Include performance benchmarks and expected cache hit rates

#### 4.3: Create Team Guidelines
Establish team processes and guidelines for build cache management.
- Create **docs/build-cache-team-guidelines.md** with cache maintenance procedures
- Document cache invalidation strategies for major refactoring
- Establish monitoring and alerting procedures for cache performance
- Define roles and responsibilities for cache infrastructure maintenance

## Manual testing plan
- Perform clean build on local machine and verify cache directory creation
- Run identical build twice and confirm second build completes faster with cache hits
- Test cache behavior across different branches and verify appropriate cache invalidation
- Validate remote cache connectivity and authentication from different development environments
- Verify CI/CD pipeline cache integration by monitoring build logs for cache statistics
- Test cache performance under various scenarios (incremental builds, clean builds, dependency changes)
- Confirm cache cleanup policies work correctly and don't consume excessive disk space
- Validate that cache exclusions work properly for non-cacheable tasks
