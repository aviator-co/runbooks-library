# Implement Build Step Skipping
Add functionality to conditionally skip build steps based on configuration flags and runtime conditions to optimize build performance.

## Summary of changes
- Current build system executes all steps sequentially without conditional logic
- Add configuration-driven step skipping mechanism with runtime evaluation
- Implement skip conditions based on file changes, environment variables, and explicit flags
- Add logging and reporting for skipped steps to maintain build transparency
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing build configurations

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Core Infrastructure
Establish the foundational components for build step skipping functionality.

#### 1.1: Add Skip Configuration Schema
Define the configuration structure for specifying skip conditions in build definitions.
- Create **src/build/config/skip-config.ts** with TypeScript interfaces for skip conditions
- Add support for file-based, environment-based, and explicit skip conditions
- Include validation logic for skip configuration syntax
- Add unit tests in **tests/build/config/skip-config.test.ts**

#### 1.2: Implement Skip Condition Evaluator
Create the core logic to evaluate whether a build step should be skipped.
- Create **src/build/evaluators/skip-evaluator.ts** with condition evaluation logic
- Implement file change detection using git diff or file timestamps
- Add environment variable and flag-based condition checking
- Create comprehensive unit tests in **tests/build/evaluators/skip-evaluator.test.ts**

#### 1.3: Extend Build Step Interface
Modify existing build step definitions to support skip configuration.
- Update **src/build/types/build-step.ts** to include optional skip configuration
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing build step definitions
- Add TypeScript type definitions for skip-enabled build steps
- Update existing build step unit tests to verify interface compatibility

### Step 2: Build Engine Integration
Integrate skip functionality into the main build execution engine.

#### 2.1: Modify Build Executor
Update the build execution logic to evaluate and apply skip conditions.
- Modify **src/build/executor/build-executor.ts** to check skip conditions before step execution
- Add skip evaluation logging with detailed reasoning for each decision
- Implement skip result caching to avoid redundant evaluations
- Update **tests/build/executor/build-executor.test.ts** with skip functionality test cases

#### 2.2: Add Skip Reporting
Implement comprehensive reporting for skipped build steps.
- Create **src/build/reporting/skip-reporter.ts** for skip statistics and summaries
- Add skip information to build output logs and JSON reports
- Include time savings calculations and skip reason details
- Create unit tests in **tests/build/reporting/skip-reporter.test.ts**

#### 2.3: Update Build Configuration Parser
Enhance configuration parsing to handle skip definitions.
- Modify **src/build/config/config-parser.ts** to parse skip configurations from build files
- Add validation for skip condition syntax and dependencies
- Implement configuration inheritance for nested skip conditions
- Update parser tests in **tests/build/config/config-parser.test.ts**

### Step 3: CLI and User Interface
Provide user-facing interfaces for controlling build step skipping.

#### 3.1: Add CLI Skip Options
Implement command-line flags for skip control and override.
- Add **--skip-steps**, **--force-all**, and **--skip-conditions** flags to **src/cli/build-command.ts**
- Implement skip condition override functionality for debugging and testing
- Add help documentation and usage examples for skip-related flags
- Create CLI integration tests in **tests/cli/build-command-skip.test.ts**

#### 3.2: Create Skip Configuration Validation Tool
Build a utility for validating and testing skip configurations.
- Create **src/tools/validate-skip-config.ts** as a standalone validation utility
- Add dry-run functionality to preview skip decisions without executing builds
- Implement configuration linting with helpful error messages
- Add tool tests in **tests/tools/validate-skip-config.test.ts**

#### 3.3: Update Build Status Dashboard
Enhance existing build status displays to show skip information.
- Modify **src/ui/build-status.ts** to display skipped steps with reasoning
- Add skip statistics to build summary views
- Implement color-coded skip indicators in terminal output
- Update UI component tests in **tests/ui/build-status.test.ts**

### Step 4: Documentation and Examples
Create comprehensive documentation and example configurations for the skip functionality.

#### 4.1: Create Skip Configuration Guide
Document the skip functionality with practical examples and best practices.
- Create **docs/build-skip-configuration.md** with complete skip configuration reference
- Include common skip patterns for different build scenarios
- Add troubleshooting guide for skip condition debugging
- Document performance impact and recommendations

#### 4.2: Add Integration Examples
Provide real-world examples of skip configurations for different project types.
- Create **examples/skip-configs/** directory with sample configurations
- Add examples for frontend, backend, and full-stack project skip patterns
- Include CI/CD integration examples with environment-based skipping
- Document example usage and expected outcomes

#### 4.3: Update API Documentation
Enhance existing API documentation to include skip functionality.
- Update **docs/api-reference.md** with skip-related API endpoints and methods
- Add TypeScript interface documentation for skip configurations
- Include code examples for programmatic skip condition usage
- Document backward compatibility guarantees and migration paths

## Manual testing plan
- Create a test project with multiple build steps and configure various skip conditions
- Verify skip conditions work correctly with file changes by modifying different source files
- Test environment variable-based skipping in different deployment environments
- Validate CLI override flags work as expected and can force execution of normally skipped steps
- Confirm build performance improvements by measuring execution time with and without skipping
- Test skip reporting accuracy by comparing logged skip reasons with actual conditions
- Verify backward compatibility by running existing build configurations without modifications
- Test error handling by providing invalid skip configurations and verifying helpful error messages
