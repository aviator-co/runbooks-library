# Implement Incremental Builds in Jenkins

Implement incremental build capabilities in Jenkins to reduce build times by only building changed components and their dependencies.

## Summary of changes
- Current Jenkins setup builds entire codebase on every commit, leading to long build times and resource waste
- Implement change detection mechanism to identify modified files and affected components
- Add dependency tracking to determine which components need rebuilding based on changes
- Configure Jenkins jobs to support incremental builds with fallback to full builds when needed
- Establish build artifact caching and reuse strategies to maximize incremental build benefits

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Analysis and Planning
Initial assessment and documentation of current build system to establish baseline for incremental build implementation.

#### 1.1: Audit Current Build System
Analyze existing Jenkins configuration and build processes to understand current state and identify optimization opportunities.
- Document current Jenkins job configurations in **jenkins-audit.md**
- Map build dependencies and component relationships in the codebase
- Measure baseline build times for different types of changes (frontend, backend, tests)
- Identify bottlenecks and longest-running build stages
- Document current artifact storage and caching mechanisms

#### 1.2: Design Incremental Build Strategy
Create comprehensive design document outlining the incremental build approach and implementation plan.
- Create **incremental-build-design.md** with change detection algorithms
- Define component dependency graph and build order logic
- Specify artifact caching strategy and storage locations
- Design fallback mechanisms for when incremental builds cannot be performed
- Document integration points with existing CI/CD pipeline

### Step 2: Change Detection Infrastructure
Implement the core change detection system that will determine which files and components have been modified.

#### 2.1: Create Git Change Detection Utilities
Develop utilities to analyze Git commits and identify changed files with their impact scope.
- Create **scripts/detect-changes.sh** script to identify changed files between commits
- Implement file categorization logic (source code, tests, configuration, documentation)
- Add functions to determine affected build targets based on file paths
- Include support for merge commits and branch comparisons
- Add logging and debugging output for change detection process

#### 2.2: Implement Component Dependency Mapping
Build system to track dependencies between different components and determine rebuild requirements.
- Create **build-tools/dependency-mapper.py** to parse project structure
- Implement dependency graph generation from build files (Maven, Gradle, package.json)
- Add cross-language dependency detection (e.g., API contracts, shared libraries)
- Create **config/component-dependencies.yaml** configuration file
- Implement dependency impact analysis to determine rebuild scope

#### 2.3: Develop Build Cache Management
Create infrastructure for managing build artifacts and determining cache validity.
- Implement **build-tools/cache-manager.py** for artifact caching logic
- Create cache key generation based on source code hashes and dependencies
- Add cache validation and expiration mechanisms
- Implement cache cleanup policies to manage storage space
- Create cache statistics and reporting functionality

### Step 3: Jenkins Job Configuration
Modify Jenkins jobs to support incremental build capabilities while maintaining compatibility with existing workflows.

#### 3.1: Create Incremental Build Pipeline Template
Develop reusable Jenkins pipeline template that can be applied to different projects.
- Create **jenkins/incremental-build-pipeline.groovy** with parameterized stages
- Implement change detection stage using previously created utilities
- Add conditional build stages based on change analysis results
- Include artifact caching and retrieval logic in pipeline stages
- Add build result aggregation and reporting mechanisms

#### 3.2: Update Existing Jenkins Jobs
Modify current Jenkins job configurations to use the new incremental build capabilities.
- Update **Jenkinsfile** in main repository to use incremental build template
- Configure job parameters for incremental vs full build selection
- Add environment variables for cache locations and build metadata
- Update build triggers to pass commit range information
- Modify post-build actions to update cache and publish incremental results

#### 3.3: Implement Build Artifact Management
Set up proper artifact storage and retrieval mechanisms for incremental builds.
- Configure Jenkins artifact archiving for incremental build outputs
- Set up build artifact storage in **artifacts/** directory structure
- Implement artifact promotion pipeline for successful incremental builds
- Add artifact cleanup jobs to manage storage space
- Create artifact dependency resolution for downstream jobs

### Step 4: Testing and Validation
Comprehensive testing of incremental build system to ensure correctness and reliability.

#### 4.1: Create Incremental Build Test Suite
Develop automated tests to validate incremental build behavior and correctness.
- Create **tests/incremental-build-tests.py** with comprehensive test scenarios
- Implement tests for change detection accuracy across different file types
- Add dependency resolution validation tests
- Create cache invalidation and rebuild trigger tests
- Implement build result comparison between incremental and full builds

#### 4.2: Set Up Monitoring and Metrics
Implement monitoring system to track incremental build performance and success rates.
- Create **monitoring/build-metrics-collector.py** for gathering build statistics
- Implement build time comparison reporting (incremental vs full builds)
- Add cache hit rate and effectiveness metrics
- Create alerting for incremental build failures or performance degradation
- Set up dashboard for visualizing incremental build performance trends

#### 4.3: Create Fallback and Recovery Mechanisms
Implement robust fallback systems for when incremental builds cannot be performed safely.
- Add automatic fallback to full builds when change detection fails
- Implement build verification checks to ensure incremental build correctness
- Create manual override mechanisms for forcing full builds
- Add recovery procedures for corrupted cache or dependency issues
- Implement build result validation and automatic retry logic

### Step 5: Documentation and Training
Create comprehensive documentation and training materials for the incremental build system.

#### 5.1: Create User Documentation
Develop documentation for developers and build engineers on using the incremental build system.
- Create **docs/incremental-builds-user-guide.md** with usage instructions
- Document configuration options and customization possibilities
- Add troubleshooting guide for common incremental build issues
- Create best practices guide for maximizing incremental build benefits
- Document integration with existing development workflows

#### 5.2: Create Operational Documentation
Develop documentation for operations team on maintaining and monitoring the incremental build system.
- Create **docs/incremental-builds-ops-guide.md** with maintenance procedures
- Document monitoring and alerting setup instructions
- Add cache management and cleanup procedures
- Create disaster recovery procedures for build system failures
- Document performance tuning and optimization strategies

## Manual testing plan
- Execute incremental builds on feature branches with isolated changes to verify correct change detection
- Test incremental builds with cross-component changes to validate dependency resolution
- Verify cache hit rates and build time improvements across different change scenarios
- Test fallback mechanisms by introducing intentional failures in change detection or cache systems
- Validate build result consistency between incremental and full builds using identical source code
- Test incremental build behavior with merge commits and complex Git histories
- Verify proper cleanup and storage management of build artifacts and cache data
- Test incremental build performance under high load with multiple concurrent builds
