# Migrate Travis CI to GitLab CI

Migrate continuous integration pipeline from Travis CI to GitLab CI for improved integration and performance.

## Summary of changes

- Current project uses Travis CI with `.travis.yml` configuration for build, test, and deployment automation
- GitLab CI provides better integration with GitLab repositories and more flexible pipeline configurations
- Migration involves creating GitLab CI configuration, updating deployment scripts, and ensuring feature parity
- Remove Travis CI dependencies while maintaining all existing CI/CD functionality

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Analysis and Planning

Initial assessment of current Travis CI setup and GitLab CI requirements.

### 1.1: Audit Current Travis CI Configuration

Analyze the existing Travis CI setup to understand all build stages, dependencies, and deployment processes.

- Review **`.travis.yml`** file and document all build stages, environment variables, and scripts
- Identify all Travis CI-specific features being used (build matrix, deployment providers, etc.)
- Document external integrations and webhook dependencies on Travis CI
- Create **`docs/ci-migration-analysis.md`** with findings and migration requirements

### 1.2: Research GitLab CI Equivalents

Map Travis CI features to GitLab CI alternatives and identify any gaps or improvements.

- Research GitLab CI job syntax and pipeline structure equivalent to current Travis stages
- Identify GitLab CI runners and executor types needed for current build environment
- Document GitLab CI variable management and secret handling approaches
- Update **`docs/ci-migration-analysis.md`** with GitLab CI mapping and recommendations

### Step 2: GitLab CI Configuration Setup

Create and test the basic GitLab CI pipeline configuration.

### 2.1: Create Initial GitLab CI Pipeline

Implement basic GitLab CI configuration with essential build and test stages.

- Create **`.gitlab-ci.yml`** file with stages mapping from Travis CI build matrix
- Configure job dependencies and artifacts passing between stages
- Add environment variable definitions and secret references for GitLab CI
- Implement basic build and test jobs with same commands as Travis CI

### 2.2: Configure GitLab Runners and Environment

Set up GitLab runners and ensure build environment matches Travis CI setup.

- Configure GitLab shared runners or set up dedicated runners if needed
- Ensure Docker images or build environment matches Travis CI specifications
- Test pipeline execution with simple build and test stages
- Verify environment variables and secrets are properly configured in GitLab project settings

### Step 3: Feature Migration and Testing

Migrate advanced Travis CI features to GitLab CI equivalents.

### 3.1: Implement Build Matrix and Parallel Jobs

Recreate Travis CI build matrix functionality using GitLab CI parallel jobs and variables.

- Convert Travis CI build matrix to GitLab CI parallel jobs with different variable combinations
- Implement job templating and inheritance for reducing configuration duplication
- Configure artifact collection and test result reporting
- Test parallel execution and ensure all matrix combinations work correctly

### 3.2: Migrate Deployment and Release Pipeline

Port Travis CI deployment configuration to GitLab CI deployment jobs.

- Create deployment jobs for each environment (staging, production) with appropriate conditions
- Configure deployment scripts and credential management in GitLab CI
- Implement release automation and artifact publishing equivalent to Travis CI setup
- Add manual deployment triggers and approval processes where needed

### 3.3: Setup Notifications and Integrations

Configure external integrations and notification systems for GitLab CI.

- Set up Slack/email notifications for build status equivalent to Travis CI notifications
- Configure webhook integrations for external services that depend on CI status
- Update any external monitoring or deployment tools to use GitLab CI webhooks
- Test all notification channels and external integrations

### Step 4: Documentation and Cleanup

Update project documentation and remove Travis CI configuration.

### 4.1: Update Project Documentation

Revise all documentation references from Travis CI to GitLab CI.

- Update **`README.md`** with GitLab CI build badges and pipeline status links
- Modify contributing guidelines to reference GitLab CI instead of Travis CI
- Update deployment and release documentation with new GitLab CI processes
- Create **`docs/gitlab-ci-guide.md`** with pipeline overview and troubleshooting guide

### 4.2: Remove Travis CI Configuration

Clean up Travis CI configuration and dependencies after successful GitLab CI validation.

- Remove **`.travis.yml`** file from repository
- Remove Travis CI build badges and status references from documentation
- Disable Travis CI integration in repository settings
- Archive or document final Travis CI build results for reference

## Manual testing plan

- Trigger GitLab CI pipeline manually and verify all stages execute successfully
- Test parallel job execution by pushing commits that should trigger build matrix
- Verify deployment pipeline by creating a release tag and confirming deployment to staging environment
- Test notification system by intentionally breaking a test and confirming failure notifications
- Validate artifact generation and storage by downloading build artifacts from GitLab CI
- Confirm external integrations work by checking webhook deliveries and third-party service updates
- Verify environment variable and secret access by checking deployment logs (without exposing sensitive data)
- Test pipeline performance by comparing build times between Travis CI historical data and new GitLab CI runs
