# Migrate SVN to Git Version Control
Complete migration from Subversion (SVN) to Git version control system while preserving history, branches, and tags.

## Summary of changes
- Current codebase is managed in SVN with multiple branches, tags, and commit history spanning several years
- Migration will preserve complete commit history, author information, branches, and tags in the new Git repository
- New Git workflow will be established with proper branching strategy and CI/CD integration
- SVN repository will be archived and Git will become the primary version control system

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Pre-Migration Analysis and Setup
Comprehensive analysis of the current SVN repository structure and preparation for migration.

#### 1.1: SVN Repository Analysis
Analyze the current SVN repository structure to understand branches, tags, and commit patterns.
- Clone the SVN repository locally for analysis: `svn checkout <svn-repo-url> svn-analysis`
- Document the SVN repository structure including trunk, branches, and tags layout
- Identify all active and inactive branches that need to be migrated
- Create a list of all tags and their purposes
- Analyze commit history to identify peak activity periods and potential issues
- Document any non-standard SVN conventions or custom properties used

#### 1.2: Author Mapping Preparation
Create author mapping file to ensure proper Git commit attribution.
- Extract all unique SVN authors: `svn log --xml | grep author | sort -u`
- Create **authors.txt** file mapping SVN usernames to Git format (Name <email@domain.com>)
- Verify email addresses with team members for accuracy
- Handle any service accounts or automated commit authors appropriately
- Test author mapping format with a small sample conversion

#### 1.3: Migration Environment Setup
Prepare the technical environment for performing the SVN to Git migration.
- Install git-svn tools: `sudo apt-get install git-svn` or equivalent for your OS
- Set up a dedicated migration workspace directory
- Ensure sufficient disk space (estimate 3-5x the SVN repository size)
- Configure Git global settings for the migration user
- Test git-svn functionality with a small test repository

### Step 2: Repository Migration Execution
Perform the actual migration from SVN to Git while preserving all history and metadata.

#### 2.1: Initial Git-SVN Clone
Execute the primary migration command to convert SVN repository to Git format.
- Run git-svn clone with full history: `git svn clone <svn-repo-url> --authors-file=authors.txt --no-metadata --prefix=svn/ <target-directory>`
- Monitor the migration progress and handle any authentication prompts
- Document any errors or warnings encountered during the clone process
- Verify that the migration completed successfully without corruption
- Check that all expected branches and tags are present in the Git repository

#### 2.2: Branch and Tag Conversion
Convert SVN branches and tags to proper Git format.
- List all SVN remote branches: `git branch -r`
- Convert SVN branches to local Git branches using scripts or manual commands
- Convert SVN tags to proper Git tags: `git tag <tag-name> <svn-tag-ref>`
- Remove SVN remote tracking branches that are no longer needed
- Verify that all branches and tags are properly converted and accessible
- Test checkout functionality for converted branches and tags

#### 2.3: Repository Cleanup and Optimization
Clean up the migrated repository and optimize it for Git workflows.
- Remove git-svn metadata and references: `git config --remove-section svn-remote.svn`
- Run garbage collection to optimize repository size: `git gc --aggressive`
- Verify repository integrity: `git fsck --full`
- Create **.gitignore** file based on SVN ignore properties
- Remove any SVN-specific files or directories that shouldn't be in Git
- Validate that repository size is reasonable and history is intact

### Step 3: Git Repository Setup and Integration
Establish the new Git repository infrastructure and integrate with existing development workflows.

#### 3.1: Remote Repository Creation
Set up the central Git repository on your Git hosting platform.
- Create new repository on Git hosting service (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.)
- Configure repository settings including description, visibility, and access permissions
- Set up branch protection rules for main/master branch
- Configure repository webhooks for CI/CD integration if needed
- Add the remote origin to local repository: `git remote add origin <git-repo-url>`
- Push all branches and tags to remote: `git push --all origin && git push --tags origin`

#### 3.2: Branching Strategy Implementation
Establish Git branching strategy and workflow documentation.
- Create **BRANCHING_STRATEGY.md** document outlining the new Git workflow
- Define branch naming conventions (feature/, bugfix/, release/, hotfix/)
- Set up default branch (main or master) and configure it as the primary branch
- Create development branch if following Git Flow or similar strategy
- Document merge vs rebase policies for different branch types
- Create pull request/merge request templates in **.github/** or **.gitlab/** directory

#### 3.3: CI/CD Pipeline Migration
Update continuous integration and deployment pipelines to work with Git.
- Update CI/CD configuration files to use Git instead of SVN
- Modify build scripts that reference SVN-specific commands or paths
- Update deployment scripts to use Git tags and branches for versioning
- Test CI/CD pipeline with a sample commit to ensure functionality
- Update any automated scripts or tools that interact with version control
- Document the new CI/CD workflow in **CI_CD_MIGRATION.md**

### Step 4: Team Migration and Documentation
Prepare the development team for the transition and provide necessary documentation.

#### 4.1: Developer Environment Setup
Create comprehensive setup instructions for team members to transition to Git.
- Create **GIT_SETUP_GUIDE.md** with step-by-step Git installation instructions
- Document Git configuration recommendations (user.name, user.email, etc.)
- Provide instructions for cloning the new Git repository
- Create common Git command reference sheet for SVN users
- Set up Git aliases that mirror common SVN commands for easier transition
- Document IDE/editor Git integration setup for commonly used development tools

#### 4.2: Migration Communication and Training
Develop communication plan and training materials for the team transition.
- Create **MIGRATION_ANNOUNCEMENT.md** with timeline and key information
- Schedule team training sessions on Git workflows and best practices
- Create FAQ document addressing common SVN-to-Git migration questions
- Set up Git mentorship program pairing experienced Git users with SVN users
- Document rollback procedures in case of critical issues during transition
- Create troubleshooting guide for common Git issues that SVN users might encounter

#### 4.3: Legacy SVN Archival
Properly archive the SVN repository and establish read-only access procedures.
- Create final SVN repository backup with complete history
- Set SVN repository to read-only mode to prevent accidental commits
- Create **SVN_ARCHIVE_ACCESS.md** documenting how to access historical SVN data if needed
- Update any documentation or wikis that reference SVN URLs or procedures
- Notify stakeholders about the SVN repository status change
- Plan SVN server decommissioning timeline (typically 6-12 months after migration)

## Manual testing plan
- Clone the new Git repository from scratch and verify all branches are accessible
- Check out different branches and tags to ensure they contain expected code versions
- Verify that commit history is preserved with correct author information and timestamps
- Test the CI/CD pipeline by creating a test branch, making a commit, and pushing changes
- Validate that merge/pull requests work properly with branch protection rules
- Perform a sample release process using Git tags to ensure deployment workflows function
- Have team members test their development workflow including clone, branch, commit, and push operations
- Verify that any automated tools or scripts that interact with version control work with Git
- Test rollback procedures by simulating a critical issue scenario
- Confirm that historical code references and blame information are preserved accurately
