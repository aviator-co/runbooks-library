#### 3.2: Database Migration Scripts
Create scripts for schema and data migration to managed databases.
- Create **`scripts/db-migration/export-schema.sql`** for PostgreSQL schema export
- Create **`scripts/db-migration/migrate-data.py`** for data migration with progress tracking
- Implement **`scripts/db-migration/redis-data-export.py`** for Redis data export
- Create **`scripts/db-migration/validate-migration.py`** for data integrity verification
- Add rollback scripts in **`scripts/db-migration/rollback/`** directory

#### 3.3: Application Configuration Flexibility
Implement configuration switching mechanism for gradual migration.
- Add feature flags in **`src/config/feature_flags.py`** for database switching
- Implement database router in **`src/database/router.py`** for traffic splitting
- Create configuration profiles for different migration phases
- Update application startup sequence to validate database connections
- Add logging and metrics for database connection monitoring

### Step 4: Testing and Validation
Comprehensive testing of managed database integration before production migration.

#### 4.1: Unit and Integration Tests
Update test suite to work with managed database configurations.
- Update **`tests/test_database.py`** to include managed database connection tests
- Create **`tests/test_migration.py`** for migration script validation
