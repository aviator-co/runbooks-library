# Implement Dark Mode Theme Toggle
Add a comprehensive dark mode feature with theme toggle functionality and persistent user preference storage.

## Summary of changes
- Current application lacks dark mode support and theme switching capabilities
- Implement CSS custom properties-based theming system for light and dark modes
- Add theme toggle component with icon switching and smooth transitions
- Integrate localStorage for theme preference persistence across sessions
- Update existing components to support both light and dark themes
- Ensure accessibility compliance with proper contrast ratios and ARIA labels

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Theme Infrastructure Setup
Establish the foundational theming system using CSS custom properties and create the core theme management utilities.

#### 1.1: Create CSS Custom Properties for Theming
Implement the base CSS variable system that will support both light and dark themes.
- Create **src/styles/themes.css** with CSS custom properties for colors, backgrounds, and text
- Define light theme variables (--bg-primary, --bg-secondary, --text-primary, --text-secondary, --border-color, etc.)
- Define dark theme variables with appropriate dark mode color values
- Add smooth transition properties for theme switching animations
- Import themes.css in main application CSS file

#### 1.2: Create Theme Context and Hook
Build React context and custom hook for theme state management across the application.
- Create **src/contexts/ThemeContext.js** with theme state and toggle functionality
- Implement useTheme custom hook in **src/hooks/useTheme.js** for consuming theme context
- Add theme detection logic to check system preference and localStorage
- Include theme persistence logic using localStorage API
- Wrap main App component with ThemeProvider in **src/App.js**

#### 1.3: Create Theme Utility Functions
Develop utility functions for theme operations and validation.
- Create **src/utils/themeUtils.js** with helper functions for theme management
- Add function to detect system theme preference using matchMedia API
- Implement function to validate and sanitize theme values from localStorage
- Add function to apply theme class to document root element
- Include function to handle theme change events and cleanup

### Step 2: Theme Toggle Component Implementation
Create the user interface component for theme switching with proper accessibility and visual feedback.

#### 2.1: Build Theme Toggle Button Component
Create an interactive toggle component with icon switching and accessibility features.
- Create **src/components/ThemeToggle/ThemeToggle.js** with toggle button implementation
- Add sun and moon icons for light/dark mode indication using SVG or icon library
- Implement smooth icon transition animations and hover effects
- Include proper ARIA labels and accessibility attributes for screen readers
- Add keyboard navigation support (Enter and Space key handling)

#### 2.2: Style Theme Toggle Component
Apply comprehensive styling for the theme toggle with support for both themes.
- Create **src/components/ThemeToggle/ThemeToggle.css** with component-specific styles
- Use CSS custom properties for colors that adapt to current theme
- Add hover and focus states with appropriate visual feedback
- Implement smooth rotation animations for icon transitions
- Ensure proper contrast ratios for accessibility compliance in both themes

#### 2.3: Create Theme Toggle Tests
Develop comprehensive test suite for theme toggle functionality and accessibility.
- Create **src/components/ThemeToggle/ThemeToggle.test.js** with unit tests
- Add tests for theme switching functionality and state management
- Include accessibility tests for ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation
- Test localStorage persistence and system theme detection
- Add tests for icon switching and animation behavior

### Step 3: Application-wide Theme Integration
Update existing components and layouts to support the new theming system.

#### 3.1: Update Global Styles and Layout Components
Modify main application styles and layout components to use theme variables.
- Update **src/App.css** to use CSS custom properties instead of hardcoded colors
- Modify header, navigation, and footer components to support theme variables
- Update global typography styles to use theme-aware text colors
- Add theme-aware focus outlines and selection colors
- Ensure all border colors and shadows use theme variables

#### 3.2: Update Component Library for Theme Support
Refactor existing UI components to work with both light and dark themes.
- Update button components in **src/components/Button/** to use theme variables
- Modify form input components to support theme-aware styling
- Update card and container components with theme-appropriate backgrounds
- Refactor modal and overlay components for dark mode compatibility
- Update loading spinners and progress indicators with theme colors

#### 3.3: Add Theme Toggle to Application Header
Integrate the theme toggle component into the main application navigation.
- Add ThemeToggle component to **src/components/Header/Header.js**
- Position toggle button appropriately in header layout (typically top-right)
- Update header component tests to include theme toggle functionality
- Ensure header styling works correctly with both themes
- Add responsive behavior for theme toggle on mobile devices

### Step 4: Testing and Documentation
Comprehensive testing and documentation to ensure robust theme implementation.

#### 4.1: Create Integration Tests for Theme System
Develop end-to-end tests for complete theme functionality across the application.
- Create **src/tests/theme.integration.test.js** with comprehensive theme testing
- Add tests for theme persistence across browser sessions and page refreshes
- Test theme switching behavior with multiple components rendered
- Include tests for system theme detection and automatic theme application
- Add performance tests to ensure theme switching doesn't cause layout thrashing

#### 4.2: Update Existing Component Tests
Modify existing test suites to account for theme context and ensure compatibility.
- Update component tests to render components within ThemeProvider wrapper
- Add theme-specific test cases for components with conditional styling
- Update snapshot tests to account for theme-aware CSS classes and properties
- Modify accessibility tests to verify contrast ratios in both themes
- Add tests for theme-dependent component behavior and state changes

#### 4.3: Create Theme Implementation Documentation
Document the theming system architecture and usage guidelines for future development.
- Create **docs/theming-guide.md** with comprehensive theming documentation
- Document CSS custom property naming conventions and usage patterns
- Add examples of how to make new components theme-aware
- Include troubleshooting guide for common theming issues
- Document accessibility considerations and contrast ratio requirements

## Manual testing plan
- Verify theme toggle button appears correctly in application header and responds to clicks
- Test theme switching functionality by toggling between light and dark modes multiple times
- Confirm theme preference persists after browser refresh and reopening application
- Validate that all existing components display correctly in both light and dark themes
- Check system theme detection by changing OS theme preference and opening application
- Test keyboard navigation of theme toggle using Tab, Enter, and Space keys
- Verify accessibility by using screen reader to announce theme toggle state and changes
- Test responsive behavior of theme toggle on various screen sizes and mobile devices
- Confirm smooth transitions and animations work properly during theme switching
- Validate color contrast ratios meet WCAG guidelines in both themes using accessibility tools
