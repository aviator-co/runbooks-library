# Migrate Java 11 to Java 17

Upgrade the Java runtime and build configuration from Java 11 to Java 17 while maintaining compatibility and stability.

## Summary of changes

- Current project is running on Java 11 with associated build configurations and dependencies
- Java 17 introduces new language features, performance improvements, and security updates
- Migration requires updating build tools, dependencies, CI/CD pipelines, and handling potential compatibility issues
- Gradual rollout approach to minimize risk and ensure smooth transition across all environments

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Environment Assessment and Preparation

Prepare the development environment and assess current state before beginning the migration.

### 1.1: Java 17 Development Environment Setup

Install and configure Java 17 development environment alongside existing Java 11 setup.

- Install Java 17 JDK (OpenJDK or Oracle) on development machines
- Configure IDE (IntelliJ IDEA/Eclipse/VS Code) to recognize Java 17 installation
- Update **JAVA_HOME** environment variable configuration files but keep Java 11 as default
- Verify Java 17 installation with `java -version` command

### 1.2: Dependency Compatibility Analysis

Analyze all project dependencies for Java 17 compatibility and identify potential issues.

- Review **pom.xml** or **build.gradle** for all direct dependencies and their Java 17 compatibility
- Check third-party library documentation for Java 17 support status
- Identify dependencies that may need version upgrades for Java 17 compatibility
- Document any libraries that may not support Java 17 and plan alternatives

### 1.3: [NO-CODE-CHANGE] Migration Risk Assessment

Document potential risks and create rollback procedures for the migration.

- Create comprehensive backup procedures for current working state
- Document current performance baselines and key metrics to compare post-migration
- Establish rollback criteria and procedures if issues arise during migration
- Plan communication strategy for team members about the migration timeline

### Step 2: Build Configuration Updates

Update build tools and configuration files to support Java 17 while maintaining backward compatibility initially.

### 2.1: Maven/Gradle Java Version Configuration

Update build tool configuration to use Java 17 as the target version.

- Update **pom.xml** `maven.compiler.source` and `maven.compiler.target` properties to version 17
- Update **pom.xml** `java.version` property to 17 in properties section
- If using Gradle, update **build.gradle** `sourceCompatibility` and `targetCompatibility` to JavaVersion.VERSION_17
- Update Maven Compiler Plugin version to latest compatible version (3.10.1 or newer)

### 2.2: Maven/Gradle Plugin Updates

Upgrade build plugins to versions that support Java 17.

- Update **maven-surefire-plugin** to version 3.0.0-M7 or newer for test execution compatibility
- Update **maven-failsafe-plugin** to version 3.0.0-M7 or newer for integration test compatibility
- Update **jacoco-maven-plugin** to version 0.8.7 or newer for code coverage with Java 17
- If using Spring Boot, update **spring-boot-maven-plugin** to version 2.6.0 or newer

### 2.3: IDE Configuration Updates

Update IDE project settings to use Java 17 for compilation and execution.

Upgrade project dependencies to versions compatible with Java 17.

### 3.1: Spring Framework Updates

Update Spring Framework and Spring Boot to Java 17 compatible versions.

- Update individual Spring dependencies (spring-core, spring-web, etc.) to compatible versions
- Update Spring Security dependencies to versions 5.6.0 or newer
- Test application startup and basic functionality after Spring updates

### 3.2: Testing Framework Updates

Update testing frameworks and libraries to Java 17 compatible versions.

- Update JUnit dependency to version 5.8.0 or newer in **pom.xml** or **build.gradle**
- Update Mockito dependency to version 4.0.0 or newer for Java 17 compatibility
- Update AssertJ dependency to version 3.21.0 or newer
- Update TestContainers dependency to version 1.16.0 or newer if used

### 3.3: Additional Library Updates

Update remaining third-party libraries to Java 17 compatible versions.

- Update Jackson dependencies to version 2.13.0 or newer for JSON processing
- Update Hibernate/JPA dependencies to version 5.6.0 or newer
- Update logging frameworks (Logback, Log4j2) to latest versions supporting Java 17
- Update any database drivers (JDBC) to versions compatible with Java 17

### Step 4: Code Compatibility and Migration

Address code-level changes required for Java 17 compatibility and leverage new features where beneficial.

### 4.1: Deprecated API Removal

Remove usage of APIs deprecated in Java 11 and removed in Java 17.

- Replace `new Integer()` constructor calls with `Integer.valueOf()` method calls
- Replace deprecated `SecurityManager` usage with modern security approaches
- Update any usage of removed `sun.*` packages with standard alternatives
- Fix any compiler warnings related to deprecated API usage

### 4.2: Module System Compatibility

Ensure code compatibility with Java Module System (JIGSAW) if modules are used.

- Add **module-info.java** files if using explicit modules
- Review and update module declarations for Java 17 compatibility
- Ensure proper module exports and requires clauses
- Test module loading and dependency resolution

### 4.3: New Java 17 Features Integration

Optionally integrate beneficial Java 17 features into existing codebase.

- Consider using **sealed classes** for restricted inheritance hierarchies where appropriate
- Evaluate **pattern matching for instanceof** to simplify type checking code
- Consider **text blocks** for multi-line string literals in configuration or SQL queries
- Update **switch expressions** syntax where it improves code readability

### Step 5: Testing and Validation
