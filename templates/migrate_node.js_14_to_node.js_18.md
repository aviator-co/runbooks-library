## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Pre-Migration Analysis
Comprehensive assessment of current codebase and dependencies for Node.js 18 compatibility.

#### 1.1: Dependency Compatibility Audit
Create a comprehensive analysis of all dependencies and their Node.js 18 compatibility status.
- Run `npm ls --depth=0` to list all direct dependencies with versions
- Create **migration-analysis.md** document in project root with current dependency versions
- Research each dependency's Node.js 18 compatibility on npm registry and GitHub
- Document any dependencies that require updates or have known compatibility issues
- Identify deprecated Node.js APIs used in codebase using `node --check` on main entry points

#### 1.2: Code Analysis for Breaking Changes
Analyze codebase for Node.js 18 breaking changes and deprecated API usage.
- Search codebase for usage of `--experimental-fetch` flag (now default in Node.js 18)
- Identify usage of deprecated `substr()` method and replace with `substring()`
- Check for OpenSSL legacy provider usage that may break in Node.js 18
- Document findings in **migration-analysis.md** under "Breaking Changes" section
- Create list of required code modifications in the analysis document

#### 1.3: Environment Assessment
Document current deployment and development environment configurations.
- List all environments (development, staging, production) with current Node.js versions
- Document CI/CD pipeline Node.js version configurations in **migration-analysis.md**
- Identify Docker base images and their Node.js versions
- Record package manager versions (npm/yarn) currently in use
- Document any Node.js version-specific tooling or scripts

### Step 2: Development Environment Setup
Prepare development environment for Node.js 18 testing and validation.

- Run `npm install` to reinstall dependencies with Node.js 18

#### 2.2: Package Manager Updates
Update package manager and validate basic functionality.
- Update npm to latest compatible version: `npm install -g npm@latest`
- Verify package-lock.json is regenerated with Node.js 18 compatible lockfile version
- Run `npm audit` to check for security vulnerabilities with new dependency tree
- Test basic npm scripts: `npm run build`, `npm run test`, `npm run lint`
- Document any immediate failures in **migration-analysis.md**

- Document any security-related changes in **migration-analysis.md**

### Step 4: Code Compatibility Updates
Modify application code to be compatible with Node.js 18 breaking changes.

#### 4.1: API Deprecation Fixes
Replace deprecated Node.js APIs with current alternatives.
- Replace `substr()` calls with `substring()` or `slice()` throughout codebase
- Update any usage of deprecated `url.parse()` with `new URL()` constructor
- Replace deprecated `crypto.createCipher()` with `crypto.createCipherGCM()`
- Update any legacy `util.isArray()` calls with `Array.isArray()`
- Run tests after each API replacement to ensure functionality is preserved

#### 4.2: Fetch API Integration
Handle the new built-in fetch API that's now available by default in Node.js 18.
- Remove `node-fetch` dependency if used, as fetch is now built-in
- Update import statements from `import fetch from 'node-fetch'` to global `fetch`
