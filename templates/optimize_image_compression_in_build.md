# Optimize Image Compression in Build Pipeline
Implement automated image compression and optimization in the build process to reduce bundle size and improve application performance.

## Summary of changes
- Current build pipeline lacks image optimization, resulting in large uncompressed images being included in production bundles
- Add image compression tools and webpack loaders to automatically optimize PNG, JPEG, and WebP images during build
- Implement progressive JPEG encoding and lossless PNG compression with configurable quality settings
- Add build-time image format conversion to modern formats like WebP with fallbacks
- Establish image optimization metrics and monitoring to track compression effectiveness

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Analysis and Planning
Establish baseline metrics and create optimization strategy for the image compression implementation.

#### 1.1: Audit Current Image Usage
Analyze existing images in the codebase to understand current state and optimization opportunities.
- Create script **`scripts/analyze-images.js`** to scan all image files in **`src/`**, **`public/`**, and **`assets/`** directories
- Generate report showing file sizes, formats, dimensions, and usage locations for all images
- Identify largest images and most frequently used images that would benefit most from optimization
- Document findings in **`docs/image-optimization-audit.md`** with recommendations for each image category

#### 1.2: Research Image Optimization Tools
Evaluate available tools and libraries for implementing image compression in the build pipeline.
- Research webpack image optimization loaders: **imagemin-webpack-plugin**, **image-webpack-loader**, **next-optimized-images**
- Compare compression libraries: **imagemin**, **sharp**, **squoosh** for different image formats
- Document tool comparison matrix in **`docs/image-optimization-tools.md`** with pros/cons and performance benchmarks
- Select primary and fallback tools based on project requirements and browser support needs

### Step 2: Infrastructure Setup
Install and configure the foundational image optimization tools and dependencies.

#### 2.1: Install Image Optimization Dependencies
Add required packages for image compression and optimization to the project.
- Install **imagemin** and format-specific plugins: **imagemin-mozjpeg**, **imagemin-pngquant**, **imagemin-webp**
- Add **image-webpack-loader** to handle build-time image optimization
- Install **sharp** as backup image processing library for Node.js scripts
- Update **package.json** with new dependencies and add npm scripts for image optimization tasks

#### 2.2: Configure Webpack Image Loader
Set up webpack configuration to automatically compress images during the build process.
- Add **image-webpack-loader** configuration to **`webpack.config.js`** or **`next.config.js`**
- Configure compression settings for JPEG (quality: 85, progressive: true), PNG (quality: 80-90), and WebP (quality: 80)
- Set up file size thresholds to skip optimization for very small images (< 1KB)
- Add development vs production environment configurations with different optimization levels

### Step 3: Image Format Optimization
Implement modern image format support with automatic conversion and fallback mechanisms.

#### 3.1: Add WebP Generation Support
Configure automatic WebP generation for supported images with fallback to original formats.
- Extend webpack configuration to generate WebP versions alongside original images
- Create **`utils/image-formats.js`** helper to detect browser WebP support
- Implement picture element generation utility in **`components/OptimizedImage.jsx`** for automatic format selection
- Add WebP mime type configuration to server settings in **`.htaccess`** or **`nginx.conf`**

#### 3.2: Implement Responsive Image Generation
Add support for generating multiple image sizes for responsive design optimization.
- Configure **image-webpack-loader** to generate multiple sizes (320w, 640w, 1024w, 1920w) for large images
- Create **`components/ResponsiveImage.jsx`** component with srcset and sizes attributes
- Add breakpoint configuration in **`config/image-breakpoints.js`** for consistent sizing across the application
- Update existing image usage to use responsive image component where appropriate

### Step 4: Build Integration
Integrate image optimization seamlessly into the existing build and deployment pipeline.

#### 4.1: Add Build-Time Image Processing
Create build scripts to handle image optimization as part of the standard build process.
- Create **`scripts/optimize-images.js`** to run image compression on all static assets
- Add pre-build hook in **`package.json`** scripts to automatically optimize images before webpack processing
- Configure build pipeline to cache optimized images to avoid reprocessing unchanged files
- Add build step validation to ensure all images meet size and quality thresholds

#### 4.2: Configure CI/CD Pipeline Integration
Update continuous integration to include image optimization validation and processing.
- Add image optimization step to **`.github/workflows/build.yml`** or **`.gitlab-ci.yml`**
- Create image size regression test that fails build if total image payload increases significantly
- Configure artifact caching for optimized images to speed up subsequent builds
- Add build metrics collection to track compression ratios and total size savings

### Step 5: Monitoring and Validation
Establish metrics and monitoring to track the effectiveness of image optimization.

#### 5.1: Add Image Optimization Metrics
Implement tracking and reporting for image compression effectiveness and performance impact.
- Create **`scripts/image-metrics.js`** to generate before/after compression reports
- Add bundle analyzer integration to track image payload size in production builds
- Implement Core Web Vitals monitoring to measure performance impact of optimized images
- Create dashboard or report showing compression ratios, size savings, and loading performance metrics

#### 5.2: Create Image Optimization Guidelines
Document best practices and guidelines for developers working with images in the optimized build pipeline.
- Create **`docs/image-optimization-guidelines.md`** with recommended formats, sizes, and quality settings
- Add developer workflow documentation for adding new images to the project
- Create linting rules or pre-commit hooks to validate image sizes and formats before commit
- Document troubleshooting steps for common image optimization build issues

## Manual testing plan
- Verify build process completes successfully with image optimization enabled
- Compare bundle sizes before and after optimization implementation using webpack-bundle-analyzer
- Test image loading performance on different network conditions (3G, 4G, WiFi) using browser dev tools
- Validate WebP images load correctly in supported browsers and fallback to original formats in unsupported browsers
- Check responsive images display correctly at different screen sizes and device pixel ratios
- Verify optimized images maintain acceptable visual quality across different compression levels
- Test build performance impact by measuring build time increase with image optimization enabled
- Validate CI/CD pipeline continues to work correctly with new image optimization steps
