# Migrate Docker Compose v2 to v3

Upgrade existing Docker Compose configuration from version 2 to version 3 format to leverage modern features and improved networking capabilities.

## Summary of changes
- Current Docker Compose files use version 2 format which lacks modern networking and deployment features
- Migration to version 3 will enable swarm mode compatibility, improved networking, and better resource management
- Update compose file syntax, networking configuration, and volume definitions to v3 standards
- Ensure backward compatibility and maintain existing functionality during transition

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Analysis and Planning
Conduct thorough analysis of current Docker Compose setup and plan migration strategy.

#### 1.1: Audit Current Docker Compose Configuration
Analyze existing Docker Compose files to understand current setup and identify migration requirements.
- Locate all **docker-compose.yml** and **docker-compose.override.yml** files in the project
- Document current version 2 specific configurations including networks, volumes, and service definitions
- Identify any custom networks, external volumes, and service dependencies
- Create inventory of environment variables and build contexts used across services
- Document any version 2 specific features that need special handling during migration

#### 1.2: Create Migration Assessment Document
Document findings and create migration strategy based on current configuration analysis.
- Create **docs/docker-compose-v3-migration.md** file with current state analysis
- Document version 2 features being used and their v3 equivalents
- Identify potential breaking changes and compatibility issues
- List services that require special attention during migration
- Define rollback strategy in case migration issues arise

#### 1.3: Backup Current Configuration
Create backup of existing Docker Compose configuration before starting migration.
- Create **docker-compose-v2-backup** directory in project root
- Copy all existing Docker Compose files to backup directory
- Commit backup files to version control with clear commit message
- Tag current commit as **pre-v3-migration** for easy rollback reference

### Step 2: Core Migration Implementation
Update Docker Compose files from version 2 to version 3 format with proper syntax and structure changes.

#### 2.1: Update Compose File Version and Basic Structure
Modify the main Docker Compose file to use version 3 format and update basic structure.
- Change version declaration from `version: '2'` to `version: '3.8'` in **docker-compose.yml**
- Update top-level structure to include explicit `services:`, `networks:`, and `volumes:` sections
- Migrate service definitions under the `services:` key maintaining existing service names
- Remove deprecated `version: '2'` specific syntax like `links:` declarations
- Update any `depends_on:` configurations to use proper service names without version 2 legacy syntax

#### 2.2: Migrate Network Configuration
Convert version 2 networking to version 3 format with explicit network definitions.
- Replace implicit default network with explicit network definition in `networks:` section
- Create **app-network** as the default bridge network for all services
- Update service definitions to use `networks:` key instead of deprecated `links:`
- Convert any custom networks from version 2 format to version 3 format
- Add network aliases where services were previously using container names for communication

#### 2.3: Update Volume Definitions
Migrate volume configurations from version 2 to version 3 format.
- Move named volumes from service-level to top-level `volumes:` section
- Update volume mount syntax to use long-form specification where beneficial
- Convert any version 2 volume driver configurations to version 3 format
- Update bind mount paths to use consistent absolute paths
- Add volume labels and driver options using version 3 syntax

#### 2.4: Update Service Configurations
Modernize service definitions to use version 3 features and remove deprecated options.
- Remove deprecated `links:` and replace with proper service networking
- Update `restart:` policies to use version 3 compliant values
- Convert `mem_limit:` and `memswap_limit:` to `deploy.resources.limits` format
- Update environment variable definitions to use consistent array or object format
- Migrate any version 2 specific build configurations to version 3 format

### Step 3: Testing and Validation
Validate the migrated configuration works correctly and maintains existing functionality.

#### 3.1: Validate Compose File Syntax
Ensure the migrated Docker Compose files have valid version 3 syntax.
- Run `docker-compose config` to validate syntax of **docker-compose.yml**
- Check for any validation errors or warnings in the compose file structure
- Verify all service names, network names, and volume names follow version 3 conventions
- Ensure all environment variables and build contexts are properly referenced
- Test compose file parsing with `docker-compose config --services` to list all services

#### 3.2: Test Service Startup and Communication
Verify that all services start correctly and can communicate with each other.
- Run `docker-compose up -d` to start all services in detached mode
- Verify all containers start successfully using `docker-compose ps`
- Test inter-service communication by checking network connectivity between services
- Validate that all mounted volumes are accessible and contain expected data
- Check service logs using `docker-compose logs` to ensure no startup errors

#### 3.3: Update Documentation and Scripts
Update project documentation and any automation scripts to reflect version 3 changes.
- Update **README.md** with any changes to Docker Compose usage instructions
- Modify any deployment scripts or CI/CD pipelines that reference Docker Compose
- Update development setup documentation to reflect new compose file structure
- Add notes about version 3 features now available to the development team
- Update any Docker Compose command examples in documentation

### Step 4: Cleanup and Finalization
Remove backup files and finalize the migration with proper documentation.

#### 4.1: Performance and Feature Validation
Ensure the migrated setup performs as expected and leverages version 3 improvements.
- Monitor resource usage to ensure no performance regression from migration
- Test any new version 3 features that were implemented during migration
- Validate that external network connectivity works as expected
- Check that volume persistence works correctly across container restarts
- Verify environment variable interpolation works properly in version 3 format

#### 4.2: Clean Up Migration Artifacts
Remove temporary files and finalize the migration process.
- Remove **docker-compose-v2-backup** directory after confirming migration success
- Clean up any temporary files created during migration process
- Update **docs/docker-compose-v3-migration.md** with final migration results
- Commit final migrated configuration with descriptive commit message
- Tag the commit as **docker-compose-v3-migration-complete**

## Manual testing plan
- Start fresh environment using `docker-compose up` and verify all services start without errors
- Test application functionality by accessing web interfaces and APIs to ensure services communicate properly
- Restart individual services using `docker-compose restart <service>` to verify restart policies work correctly
- Test volume persistence by creating test data, stopping containers, and verifying data remains after restart
- Validate network isolation by attempting to connect to services from external networks where appropriate
- Test environment variable substitution by modifying .env file values and restarting services
- Verify log aggregation works by checking `docker-compose logs` output for all services
- Test scaling capabilities using `docker-compose up --scale <service>=2` for scalable services
