- Configure parallel build execution to utilize available system resources efficiently
- Establish build performance monitoring and metrics collection

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Analysis and Planning
Conduct thorough analysis of current build system and create optimization strategy documentation.

#### 1.1: Build Performance Audit
Create comprehensive documentation analyzing current build performance across all packages in the monorepo.
- Profile build times for each package individually and measure total build duration
- Identify packages with longest build times and analyze their dependencies
- Document current build tools, configurations, and any existing optimization attempts
- Create **`docs/build-optimization-audit.md`** with findings and baseline metrics
- Analyze build logs to identify redundant operations and bottlenecks

#### 1.2: Dependency Graph Analysis
Map out the complete dependency structure of the monorepo to understand build order requirements.
- Generate dependency graph visualization using tools like **`madge`** or **`nx graph`**
- Identify circular dependencies that may impact build optimization
- Document critical path packages that block other builds
- Create **`docs/dependency-analysis.md`** with graph diagrams and optimization opportunities
- Analyze which packages can be built in parallel without conflicts

#### 1.3: Optimization Strategy Planning
Define the comprehensive build optimization strategy based on audit findings.
- Document selected optimization techniques (caching, incremental builds, parallelization)
- Create implementation timeline with dependencies between optimization phases
- Define success metrics and performance targets for each optimization
- Create **`docs/build-optimization-strategy.md`** with detailed implementation plan
- Identify required tooling changes and infrastructure modifications

### Step 2: Build System Infrastructure
Set up foundational infrastructure for build optimization including workspace configuration and tooling.

#### 2.1: Workspace Configuration Enhancement
Update root workspace configuration to support advanced build optimization features.
- Modify **`package.json`** to include build optimization scripts and dependencies
- Update workspace configuration in **`lerna.json`**, **`nx.json`**, or **`rush.json`** as applicable
- Configure build output directories with consistent naming conventions
- Add development dependencies for build optimization tools (**`nx`**, **`lerna`**, **`turborepo`**, etc.)
- Update **`.gitignore`** to exclude build cache directories and temporary files

#### 2.2: Build Cache Infrastructure
Implement distributed build caching system to avoid redundant builds across the monorepo.
- Create **`build-cache/`** directory structure with appropriate **`.gitignore`** entries
- Configure cache storage backend (local filesystem, Redis, or cloud storage)
- Implement cache key generation based on file content hashes and dependency versions
- Create **`scripts/cache-manager.js`** utility for cache operations and cleanup
- Add cache validation and integrity checking mechanisms

#### 2.3: Build Orchestration Setup
Configure build orchestration system to manage complex build dependencies and parallelization.
- Install and configure chosen build orchestration tool (**`nx`**, **`turborepo`**, or **`lerna`**)
- Create **`build.config.js`** with build pipeline definitions and dependency mappings
- Configure build targets for different environments (development, staging, production)
- Set up build artifact management and output organization
- Create **`scripts/build-orchestrator.js`** for custom build logic and coordination

### Step 3: Incremental Build Implementation
Implement incremental building capabilities that only rebuild changed packages and their dependents.

#### 3.1: Change Detection System
Create robust change detection mechanism to identify which packages need rebuilding.
- Implement file hash comparison system in **`scripts/change-detector.js`**
- Create **`.build-hashes.json`** to store previous build state information
- Configure git-based change detection for commit-level incremental builds
- Add dependency impact analysis to determine downstream rebuild requirements
- Implement change detection caching to avoid redundant filesystem operations

#### 3.2: Incremental Build Logic
Develop core incremental build functionality that respects package dependencies.
- Create **`scripts/incremental-builder.js`** with smart rebuild logic
- Implement topological sorting for correct build order of changed packages
- Add build skipping logic for packages with no changes or dependency changes
- Configure build artifact reuse from previous successful builds
- Add verbose logging for build decisions and skipped packages

#### 3.3: Build State Management
Implement comprehensive build state tracking and recovery mechanisms.
- Create **`scripts/build-state-manager.js`** for persistent build state storage
- Implement build failure recovery with partial rebuild capabilities
- Add build state validation and corruption detection
- Configure build state cleanup and maintenance routines
- Create build state debugging and inspection utilities

### Step 4: Parallel Build Execution
Configure parallel build execution to maximize resource utilization while respecting dependencies.

#### 4.1: Parallel Execution Engine
Implement parallel build execution system that respects dependency constraints.
- Create **`scripts/parallel-builder.js`** with worker pool management
- Configure maximum parallel build workers based on system resources
- Implement dependency-aware scheduling to maximize parallelization
- Add resource monitoring and dynamic worker adjustment
- Configure build isolation to prevent conflicts between parallel builds

#### 4.2: Resource Management
Implement intelligent resource management for optimal parallel build performance.
- Add CPU and memory monitoring in **`scripts/resource-monitor.js`**
- Configure build worker resource limits and allocation strategies
- Implement adaptive parallelization based on available system resources
- Add build queue management with priority-based scheduling
- Configure resource cleanup and garbage collection for build processes

#### 4.3: Build Coordination
Create coordination mechanisms for complex parallel build scenarios.
- Implement inter-build communication system for shared resource coordination
- Add build progress tracking and reporting across parallel workers
- Configure build failure handling and cascade prevention in parallel execution
- Create build synchronization points for critical dependency handoffs
- Add parallel build debugging and profiling capabilities

### Step 5: Performance Monitoring
Establish comprehensive build performance monitoring and optimization feedback loops.

#### 5.1: Metrics Collection System
Implement detailed build performance metrics collection and analysis.
- Create **`scripts/build-metrics-collector.js`** for comprehensive performance tracking
- Configure metrics storage in **`build-metrics/`** directory with JSON format
- Add build time tracking per package, build phase, and overall pipeline
- Implement resource utilization metrics (CPU, memory, disk I/O)
- Configure build success/failure rate tracking and trend analysis

#### 5.2: Performance Dashboard
Create build performance visualization and monitoring dashboard.
- Implement **`scripts/performance-dashboard.js`** for metrics visualization
- Create **`build-dashboard.html`** with interactive charts and build history
- Add real-time build progress monitoring with WebSocket integration

## Manual testing plan
- Execute full monorepo build and verify all packages build successfully with optimizations enabled
- Test incremental builds by making changes to different packages and verifying only affected packages rebuild
- Validate build cache functionality by running identical builds and confirming cache hits
- Test parallel build execution by monitoring system resources during large builds
- Verify build performance improvements by comparing optimized vs unoptimized build times
- Test build failure scenarios to ensure proper error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Validate build reproducibility by running multiple builds and comparing outputs
- Test optimization with different system resource constraints (limited CPU, memory)
