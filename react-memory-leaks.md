# Fix Memory Leaks in React Components

Identify and resolve memory leaks in React components by implementing proper cleanup, removing event listeners, and canceling subscriptions.

## Summary of changes

- Audit existing React components for common memory leak patterns including unremoved event listeners, uncanceled timers, and persistent subscriptions
- Implement proper cleanup in useEffect hooks and componentWillUnmount lifecycle methods
- Add memory leak detection tooling and automated tests to prevent future regressions
- Establish coding standards and linting rules to catch memory leak patterns during development

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Analysis and Setup

Establish baseline memory usage metrics and identify components with potential memory leaks.

### 1.1: Memory Profiling Setup

Set up memory profiling tools to establish baseline metrics and identify leak patterns.

- Install **React Developer Tools Profiler** extension and configure memory profiling settings
- Add **why-did-you-render** library to development dependencies for re-render detection
- Create **memory-profile** npm script in **package.json** that runs the application with memory profiling enabled
- Document current memory usage baseline by running profiling on key user workflows

### 1.2: Component Audit

Systematically audit all React components for common memory leak patterns.

- Create **MEMORY_LEAK_AUDIT.md** file to track findings and progress
- Scan all components in **src/components** directory for event listeners without cleanup
- Identify components using timers (setTimeout, setInterval) without proper clearance
- List components with subscriptions (WebSocket, EventSource, external libraries) lacking unsubscribe logic
- Document components using refs that may hold DOM references after unmount

### 1.3: [NO-CODE-CHANGE] Create Memory Leak Prevention Guidelines

Establish coding standards and documentation for preventing memory leaks.

- Create **docs/MEMORY_LEAK_PREVENTION.md** with best practices and common patterns
- Document required cleanup patterns for different types of side effects
- Add memory leak prevention section to existing code review checklist

### Step 2: Event Listener Cleanup

Fix components with unremoved event listeners that cause memory leaks.

### 2.1: Window and Document Event Listeners

Implement proper cleanup for global event listeners attached to window and document objects.

- Identify all components using **addEventListener** on **window** or **document** objects
- Wrap event listener setup in useEffect hooks with proper cleanup functions
- Replace class component event listeners in **componentDidMount** with corresponding **componentWillUnmount** cleanup
- Add corresponding **removeEventListener** calls in cleanup functions with exact same parameters
- Update tests to verify event listeners are properly removed on component unmount

### 2.2: Custom Element Event Listeners

Fix memory leaks from event listeners attached to DOM elements and custom components.

- Locate components that add event listeners to DOM elements via refs
- Implement cleanup in useEffect return functions for functional components
- Add **componentWillUnmount** cleanup for class components with direct DOM event listeners
- Ensure event listener callbacks use consistent function references for proper removal
- Add unit tests to verify event listener cleanup using **jest.spyOn** on **addEventListener** and **removeEventListener**

### Step 3: Timer and Interval Cleanup

Resolve memory leaks from uncanceled timers and intervals.

### 3.1: setTimeout and setInterval Cleanup

Implement proper cleanup for all timer-based operations.

- Audit all components using **setTimeout** and **setInterval** functions
- Store timer IDs in useRef for functional components or instance variables for class components
- Add **clearTimeout** and **clearInterval** calls in cleanup functions
- Replace direct timer usage with custom hooks like **useTimeout** and **useInterval** that handle cleanup automatically
- Create unit tests to verify timers are canceled on component unmount using **jest.useFakeTimers**

### 3.2: Animation Frame Cleanup

Fix memory leaks from uncanceled requestAnimationFrame calls.

- Identify components using **requestAnimationFrame** for animations or smooth updates
- Store animation frame IDs and cancel them in cleanup functions using **cancelAnimationFrame**
- Implement **useAnimationFrame** custom hook with built-in cleanup for reusable animation logic
- Add tests to verify animation frames are canceled properly on component unmount

### Step 4: Subscription and Observable Cleanup

Implement proper cleanup for external subscriptions and observables.

### 4.1: WebSocket and EventSource Cleanup

Fix memory leaks from persistent connections that aren't properly closed.

- Locate components establishing **WebSocket** or **EventSource** connections
- Implement connection cleanup in useEffect return functions or **componentWillUnmount**
- Add proper error handling for connection cleanup to prevent cleanup failures
- Store connection instances in refs or instance variables for reliable cleanup access
- Create integration tests to verify connections are closed on component unmount

### 4.2: Third-party Library Subscriptions

Implement cleanup for subscriptions to external libraries and services.

- Identify components subscribing to libraries like **Redux**, **MobX**, or **RxJS** observables
- Implement unsubscribe logic in cleanup functions for all active subscriptions
- Store subscription references for proper cleanup in component unmount
- Replace direct subscription usage with custom hooks that handle cleanup automatically
- Add tests to mock external libraries and verify unsubscribe calls on component unmount

### Step 5: Ref and DOM Reference Cleanup

Resolve memory leaks from persistent DOM references and circular references.

### 5.1: Ref Cleanup in Functional Components

Implement proper cleanup for useRef hooks that may hold persistent references.

- Identify useRef usage that stores DOM elements or complex objects
- Clear ref values in cleanup functions by setting **ref.current = null**
- Review callback refs to ensure they set **null** when component unmounts
- Replace imperative DOM manipulation with declarative React patterns where possible
- Add tests to verify refs are properly nullified on component unmount

### 5.2: Class Component Ref Cleanup

Fix memory leaks from instance variables and refs in class components.

- Audit class components for instance variables storing DOM references or large objects
- Implement **componentWillUnmount** methods to clear all instance variable references
- Set callback refs to **null** in unmount lifecycle method
- Clear any cached data or computation results stored in instance variables
- Add tests to verify class component instance variables are properly cleaned up

### Step 6: Testing and Validation

Implement automated tests and validation to prevent future memory leaks.

### 6.1: Memory Leak Detection Tests

Create automated tests that detect memory leaks in components.

- Install **@testing-library/react** and configure memory leak detection utilities
- Create **src/utils/memory-leak-test-utils.js** with helper functions for leak detection
- Write unit tests for each fixed component that mount, unmount, and verify cleanup
- Implement integration tests that stress test components with rapid mount/unmount cycles
- Add memory usage assertions using **performance.memory** API where available

### 6.2: Linting Rules for Memory Leak Prevention

Add ESLint rules to catch common memory leak patterns during development.

- Install **eslint-plugin-react-hooks** and configure memory-related rules
- Add custom ESLint rules to detect missing cleanup for timers and event listeners
- Configure **eslint-plugin-react** rules to catch missing **componentWillUnmount** methods
- Add pre-commit hooks to run memory leak linting checks
- Update **CI/CD pipeline** to fail builds on memory leak rule violations

## Manual testing plan

- Navigate through the application's main user flows while monitoring memory usage in browser DevTools
- Perform rapid navigation between pages to test component mount/unmount cycles
- Open and close modals, dropdowns, and dynamic components repeatedly to verify cleanup
- Use React Developer Tools Profiler to record memory usage during extended browsing sessions
- Monitor browser console for warnings about memory leaks or cleanup issues
- Test application performance on mobile devices to verify memory usage improvements
- Leave the application idle for extended periods and verify memory usage remains stable
