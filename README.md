# Runbooks Library

A comprehensive collection of Runbook templates for AI-powered code migrations, refactoring, and systematic code improvements. These templates provide structured, step-by-step instructions that can be executed by AI coding agents to automate complex development tasks.

## What are Runbooks?

Runbooks are structured markdown documents that define step-by-step procedures for code modifications, migrations, and improvements. Each Runbook contains:

- **Clear objectives** - What the migration/change accomplishes
- **Detailed steps** - Specific, actionable instructions for AI agents
- **Context and rationale** - Why each change is needed
- **Validation criteria** - How to verify successful completion

Runbooks can be executed by AI coding agents like [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) or used through [Aviator Runbooks](https://aviator.co/runbooks).

## Usage

### With Claude Code

1. Copy the template you want to use
2. Provide to Claude Code as a Runbook and ask it to customize it for your code base

Example:

```
I want to migrate my React class components to hooks. Please customize this Runbook by analyzing our current codebase, and write that in a markdown file keeping the same format.

[Paste the raw Runbook here]
```

1. Execute this Rnbook with claude code, either all at once or step by step:

```markdown
Please use this new Runbook to execute Step 1 and create a PR.
```

### With Aviator Runbooks

1. **Browse templates** at [aviator.co/runbooks](https://aviator.co/runbooks)
2. **Select a template** that matches your needs
3. **Customize and execute** through the Aviator platform.

[Read the docs for details](https://docs.aviator.co/runbooks/concepts/templates).

### Manual Implementation

Each template can also be used as a manual checklist:
1. **Review the template** steps carefully
2. **Adapt instructions** to your specific codebase
3. **Execute steps manually** or with your preferred tools

## Template Structure

Each Runbook template follows this structure:

```markdown
# Runbook: [A short title of Runbook]

## Summary of changes
- List of findings based on the current code
- High level summary of changes that are covered in the steps below

## Prerequisites
- Links to other resources that could be relevant (e.g. code review guidelines)
- Some considerations and requirements that must be true

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: [Category Name]
Context if needed to explain the category, limit to 2-3 lines.
#### 1.1: [Task Name]
Description of the task with context. Do not use list items for this.
- Concrete substep description 1 as a list. \
Use trailing backslash for multiple lines.
- Concrete substep description 2 as a list.

#### 1.2: [Task Name]
Description of the task with context. Do not use list items for this.
- Concrete substep description A as a list.
- Concrete substep description B as a list.
- Concrete substep description C as a list.

#### 1.3: [NO-CODE-CHANGE] [Documentation Task Name]
Description of a documentation/planning task that doesn't generate code changes.
- Documentation substep A as a list.
- Planning substep B as a list.

### Step 2: [Category Name]
#### 2.1: [Task Name]
Description of the task with context. Do not use list items for this.
- Concrete substep description A as a list.
