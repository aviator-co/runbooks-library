# React Class to Hooks Migration

Migrate all React class components to functional components using hooks to improve performance, reduce bundle size, and modernize the codebase.

## Summary of changes

- Audit existing class components and identify migration complexity levels
- Create utility functions and custom hooks to handle common patterns
- Migrate components in dependency order (leaf components first, then parents)
- Update tests to work with functional components and hooks
- Remove class component utilities and legacy code after migration

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Analysis and Preparation

Establish migration strategy and identify all components requiring changes.

### 1.1: Component Inventory and Analysis

Create a comprehensive inventory of all class components and their migration complexity.

- Create **`docs/react-hooks-migration.md`** document with component inventory
- Scan codebase for all files containing `extends React.Component` or `extends Component`
- Categorize components by complexity: Simple (state + lifecycle), Medium (complex state/refs), Complex (legacy patterns)
- Document dependencies between components to determine migration order
- Identify shared patterns that can be extracted into custom hooks

### 1.2: Migration Utilities Setup

Set up helper functions and custom hooks for common migration patterns.

- Create **`src/hooks/`** directory for custom hooks
- Create **`src/hooks/usePrevious.js`** hook for componentDidUpdate patterns
- Create **`src/hooks/useDidMount.js`** hook for componentDidMount patterns
- Create **`src/hooks/useWillUnmount.js`** hook for componentWillUnmount patterns
- Add these hooks to **`src/hooks/index.js`** for easy importing

### 1.3: Testing Infrastructure Updates

Prepare testing utilities to work with both class and functional components during migration.

- Update **`src/test-utils.js`** to include React Testing Library utilities
- Create helper functions for testing hooks in **`src/test-utils/hook-testing.js`**
- Update Jest configuration in **`package.json`** or **`jest.config.js`** to support hook testing
- Document testing patterns for hooks in **`docs/testing-hooks.md`**

### Step 2: Simple Component Migration

Migrate leaf components with minimal state and simple lifecycle methods.

### 2.1: Migrate Simple Leaf Components

Convert components with basic state and lifecycle methods to hooks.

- Identify 5-10 simple leaf components from the inventory
- For each component, replace `this.state` with `useState` hooks
- Replace `componentDidMount` with `useEffect` with empty dependency array
- Replace `componentWillUnmount` with `useEffect` cleanup functions
- Update all `this.setState` calls to use state setter functions
- Update corresponding test files to use React Testing Library patterns

### 2.2: Update Component Props and Refs

Convert class-based prop and ref patterns to functional component equivalents.

- Replace `React.createRef()` with `useRef` hooks
- Update ref forwarding using `React.forwardRef` where needed
- Convert `this.props` references to destructured props parameter
- Update defaultProps to use default parameters or separate defaultProps object
- Ensure propTypes definitions remain intact

### 2.3: Validate Simple Component Migrations

Test and verify the migrated simple components work correctly.

- Run existing test suites for migrated components
- Perform manual testing of migrated components in development environment
- Update **`docs/react-hooks-migration.md`** with completed simple components
- Create pull request for simple component migrations
- Address any failing tests or runtime issues

### Step 3: Medium Complexity Component Migration

Migrate components with complex state management and multiple lifecycle methods.

### 3.1: Create Complex Custom Hooks

Build reusable hooks for common complex patterns found in medium complexity components.

- Create **`src/hooks/useAsync.js`** for async operations and loading states
- Create **`src/hooks/useLocalStorage.js`** for localStorage interactions
- Create **`src/hooks/useApi.js`** for API call patterns with loading/error states
- Create **`src/hooks/useForm.js`** for form handling patterns
- Add comprehensive tests for each custom hook in **`src/hooks/__tests__/`**

### 3.2: Migrate Medium Complexity Components

Convert components with complex state management and lifecycle combinations.

- Identify medium complexity components from inventory (typically 5-15 components)
- Replace complex state objects with multiple `useState` hooks or `useReducer`
- Convert `componentDidUpdate` patterns using `useEffect` with specific dependencies
- Migrate error boundary patterns to functional components where possible
- Replace `shouldComponentUpdate` with `React.memo` and custom comparison functions
- Update tests to work with new hook-based implementations

### 3.3: Performance Optimization Pass

Optimize the migrated medium complexity components for performance.

- Wrap expensive components with `React.memo`
- Use `useCallback` for function props passed to child components
- Use `useMemo` for expensive calculations
- Audit and optimize effect dependencies to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Add performance tests or benchmarks for critical components

### Step 4: Complex Component Migration

Handle the most complex components with intricate patterns and legacy code.

### 4.1: Legacy Pattern Analysis

Analyze and document complex patterns that need special handling.

- Identify components using deprecated lifecycle methods (`componentWillMount`, etc.)
- Document components with complex `componentDidUpdate` logic
- Analyze Higher-Order Components (HOCs) that may need conversion to custom hooks
- Create migration strategies for each unique complex pattern in **`docs/complex-migration-patterns.md`**

### 4.2: HOC to Custom Hooks Migration

Convert Higher-Order Components to equivalent custom hooks.

- Identify HOCs that can be converted to custom hooks
- Create custom hook equivalents for each HOC
- Update components using these HOCs to use the new custom hooks instead
- Maintain backward compatibility by keeping HOCs until all usage is migrated
- Update documentation and examples to use custom hooks

### 4.3: Complex Component Conversion

Migrate the remaining complex components using established patterns.

- Convert complex lifecycle method combinations using appropriate `useEffect` patterns
- Use `useReducer` for components with complex state management logic
- Implement custom hooks for component-specific complex logic
- Handle context providers and consumers migration to `useContext`
- Update all tests and ensure feature parity with original class components

### Step 5: Cleanup and Optimization

Remove legacy code and optimize the fully migrated codebase.

### 5.1: Legacy Code Removal

Remove unused class component utilities and legacy patterns.

- Remove unused lifecycle method polyfills or utilities
- Clean up class component-specific test utilities
- Remove HOCs that have been replaced with custom hooks
- Update import statements to remove unused class component dependencies
- Run linting and dead code elimination tools

### 5.2: Bundle Size Optimization

Optimize imports and dependencies for the hook-based codebase.

- Audit and remove unnecessary React imports (React 17+ JSX transform)
- Update build configuration to take advantage of tree shaking with hooks
- Analyze bundle size impact and document improvements
- Update **`docs/react-hooks-migration.md`** with performance metrics and bundle size changes

### 5.3: Documentation and Guidelines Update

Update development documentation and coding standards.

- Update component development guidelines to prefer hooks over classes
- Create **`docs/hooks-best-practices.md`** with team coding standards
- Update code review templates to include hooks-specific checks
- Create migration guide for future class components in **`docs/class-to-hooks-guide.md`**
- Update onboarding documentation to reflect hooks-first approach

## Manual testing plan

- Test critical user flows in development environment after each migration step
- Verify component behavior matches original class component functionality
- Check for memory leaks by monitoring component mount/unmount cycles
- Test performance-critical components for regression using browser dev tools
- Validate accessibility features remain intact after migration
- Test error boundaries and error handling still work correctly
- Verify SSR (Server-Side Rendering) compatibility if applicable
- Check that all interactive features (forms, buttons, navigation) work as expected
- Test responsive design and mobile functionality remains unchanged
